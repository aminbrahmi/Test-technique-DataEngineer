{"title": "Got bullied online on my birthday: I stood up and I don’t regret it", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something that happened recently, not just to get it off my chest but also to encourage anyone who might be going through something similar.\n\nA few weeks ago, I reacted to a post in a local Facebook group. It wasn’t even a comment, just a laughing emoji on a post I felt didn’t belong there. Out of nowhere, the person who made the post tagged me and body-shamed me publicly in a comment. They went further by tagging their friends to come laugh too. It felt like a public humiliation.\n\nAt first, I tried to brush it off. It seemed small. But later that day, which happened to be my birthday, I realized I wasn’t feeling okay. I looked at photos from the day, surrounded by family trying to make me happy, and saw I wasn’t really smiling. That’s when I knew the comment had affected me more than I wanted to admit.\n\nI did some digging and noticed that this person had a pattern of posting similar things. They mocked others publicly, posted photos of strangers, and even shared videos that seemed to be taken without consent. I learned they were identifying themselves online as working for a company, so I decided to report the behavior.\n\nTo their credit, the organization took it seriously and opened an internal investigation. I later noticed that the individual removed their offensive posts, hid their profiles, and even removed their public association with the company. They also blocked me, so it became clear they knew someone had reported them.\n\nI don’t know what the final outcome will be. Honestly, I’m not looking for revenge. But I do feel proud for speaking up. I may have helped prevent future harm to others. It reminded me that silence often protects the wrong people. Just because someone is loud and bold online does not mean they are untouchable.\n\nSo if you’re ever in a similar situation, remember this: you have the right to stand up for yourself.

Which now do I think the kid was bullying me  the answer would be no, it could have been a honest question but the fact they had to think about it made me upset. (It did not help the fact I was misgender until my hair did grow back out) I was able to shrug it off, \n     My brother was a whole other bully, It’s taken me until now to realize how much it affects you to have a sibling or someone that lives with you being a bully vs pier bullying. It hurts deeper and longer because you cannot escape it. My older brother was unmedicated adhd, and had a lot of aggression issues. I was physical and mentally bullied by a young age, Called the worst names, tormented by being punched, hit, and kicked. \n   When I was old enough to venture out into my neighborhood by myself I became friends with a girl who would be one of the biggest mental manipulators i have still yet to meet but also the person who S/A me.  We had another friend who she would constantly flip between me and her and turn each other against each other. Again would be called the worst insults or they would ignore me until i would give up go home and cry. \n   One of the last bullies i let effect me was when I was in 6th grade, we sat next to each other all year she pick on me because my clothes were from walmart. But the biggest thing she would pick on is that I didn’t have any friends. \n    I was so lost and broken as a child, crazily enough the internet helped me. sorta like it is right now to help me vent and share my story. I was able to look up all my feelings and put a definition or meaning to them. But most of all I found ways to help myself. I grew and by 7th grade I no joke had 7-10 close friends! However all that mattered is that I moved on, I was able to find ways to cope with my childhood but most importantly i found ways to not blame all the bully’s in my life for what happened to me. Are they the reason yes, but everybody that hurt me i know was hurt in some way before.

{"title": "My Experience with Bullying: A Story of Survival, Growth, and Hope", "content": "School was never a pleasant place for me growing up. I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age (around six or seven), and I recently received a Level 1 ASD diagnosis as well. I’ll be turning 21 in December. Academically, I was a gifted student and often performed very well. However, I struggled significantly with social interactions and behavior regulation.\n\nDue to my neurodiversity, I displayed behaviors that were seen as disruptive: I would often leave my seat, shout out answers without raising my hand, and had difficulty waiting my turn. These behaviors made me an unpopular student. I had very few friends and was frequently bullied. In primary school, I was suspended several times, and some teachers made deeply hurtful and insensitive comments about me in front of my classmates, such as: \"Don’t learn from her,\" \"She’s a bad example,\" and \"She’s only acting this way because there’s something wrong with her.\"\n\nThe bullying I endured came from both boys and girls, though mainly boys. Some would push or kick me almost every time they saw me. I didn’t know how to protect myself and, at the time, didn’t believe in retaliating. (Looking back, I regret not taking Taekwondo classes — I’m currently taking boxing lessons to feel more empowered.)\n\nI told both my teachers and my parents about the bullying. Although teachers would scold the bullies, the behavior continued. Everything changed after an incident in Year 9. During recess, while I was chatting and having a snack with classmates, a boy — who had bullied me for years — suddenly kicked me hard in the back, causing me to fall chest-first onto the ground. That evening, I told my parents, who then contacted the boy’s parents. The next day, the boy’s father took me to a local hospital for a CT scan. Thankfully, I was okay physically. After this incident, the bullying finally stopped. A few months later, at a parent-teacher meeting, the boy’s father apologized to both me and my parents.\n\nI still remember that boy’s name. I don’t know how he’s doing now, and I honestly don’t want to know — but I hope he’s doing fine and hasn’t hurt anyone else.\n\nFast forward five or six years: I’m now doing well at university and have been managing my challenges with the support of therapy. But those bullying experiences still haunt me in dreams. I truly believe that if my school had implemented better anti-bullying policies and provided stronger mental health support, my experience could have been significantly different.\n\nDespite everything, my experience has inspired me. I now want to support children who have similar challenges, as well as the teachers and parents who work with them. It was incredibly difficult for me to share my story, but I’m doing so because I hope it will inspire others to create change.\n\nI know this was a lot to write, and English isn’t my first language, but I hope this story resonates. I’m even considering publishing a memoir someday, because we NEED more representation and research on girls and women with ADHD and ASD.", "cleaned_content": "school was never pleaser place for growing up wa diagnosed with adhd at very young ag around seven and recently received level   asd diagnosis well ill be turning   in december academically was gifted studer and often performed very well however struggled significantly with social interaction and behavior regulation \n\n devoir to my neurodiversity displayed behaviors that were seen disruptive would often leav my seat shout out answer without raising my hand and had difficulty waiting my turn these behaviors mad an unpopular studer had very few friend and was frequently bullied in primary school was suspended several time and some teacher made deeply hurtful and insensitiv comment about in front of my classmater such learn from her she bad exampl and shes only acting thi way because there something wrong with her \n\n the bullying endured cam from both boy and girl though mainly boy some would push kick almost every tim they saw didnt know how to protect myself and at the time didnt believ in retaliating looking back regret not taking taekwondo classe   im currently taking boxing lesson to feel more empowered \n\n told both my teacher and my parent about the bullying although teachers would scold the bullies the behavior continued everything changed after an incident in year   during reces whil was chatting and having snack with classmate boy   who had bullied for year   suddenly kicked hard in the back causing to fall chestfirst onto the ground that evening told my parent who then contacted the boy parent the next day the boy father took to local hospital for ct scan thankfully wer okay physically after thi incident the bullying finally stopped few month later at parentteacher meeting the boy father apologized to both and my parent \n\n still remember that boy name know how he doing now and honestly wer to know   but hope hes doing fine and hasnt hurt anyon else \n\n fast forward fiv year im now doing well at university and have been managing my challenge with the support of therapy but those bullying experience still haunt in dreams truly believe that if my school had implemented better antibullying policie and provided stronger mental health support my experience could have been significantly \n\n despite everything my experience has inspired now wer to support children who hav similar challenge well the teachers and parent who work with them it wa incredibly difficult for to share my story boire im doing so because hope it will inspir others to create change \n\n know this was lot to write and english isnt my first languag but hop thi story resonater im even considering publishing memoir someday becaus we need more representation and research girl and women with adhd and asd", "author": "RitaSu19", "date": "2025-06-04T14:06:52", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1l353kc/my_experience_with_bullying_a_story_of_survival/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

{"title": "Harassment", "content": "My Friends and I Are Being Harassed by a Former Friend Group—Can We Involve the Police or Get a Restraining Order?\n\nThis situation has been going on for years and it’s reached a point where I’m genuinely worried for my friend’s safety.\n\nBack in middle school (8th grade), my friends and I—let’s call us Beth, Mat, and me—used to be friends with this group of guys. We had a falling out, and ever since then, they’ve been harassing us. It started with spam calls, prank calls, and threatening messages. We’re now at the end of our sophomore year of high school, and it hasn’t stopped.\n\nRecently, we made a group chat to try and talk things out, hoping they’d finally leave us alone. One of our current friends got involved and told them to back off, even threatening to beat them up. While we don’t condone that, it’s worth noting these guys have been threatening us for years. One of the guys from the old group—Dylan—ran to his school counselor and reported Mat. Thankfully, Mat had proof of the harassment and didn’t get in trouble.\n\nThen Dylan and his parents went to the police and acted like he was the victim. The police talked to both Mat and Dylan and told them to leave each other alone. Mat has done exactly that—he’s completely ignored them since.\n\nBut today, Dylan crossed a line.\n\nHe showed up to our high school, followed Mat to his bus stop with two other guys, and cornered him. They intimidated him, forced him to do push-ups and jumping jacks, and threatened to beat him up if he tried to run. They recorded the whole thing, slapped him, laughed at him, and even FaceTimed their other friends to show them Mat being humiliated. Before letting him go, they told him, “You’re lucky I didn’t beat your ass,” and said this was “the end of the war.”\n\nThere was never a “war.” It’s just been years of unprovoked harassment. They’ve done similar things to me and Beth, too. At one point, they even showed up to Mat’s house when he wasn’t home, intending to jump him.\n\nThis has been going on since 8th grade. Yes, Mat said some stuff about them back then—we were literal middle schoolers. But this is relentless and way beyond petty drama.\n\nWe have tons of screenshots, texts, voicemails, and evidence of them threatening and harassing us. We don’t have video of the bus stop incident, but we might be able to get security footage.\n\nMy questions:\n\t1.\tCan we go to the police again with this? Is it too late since they already said to “leave each other alone”?\n\t2.\tCan Mat or the rest of us get a restraining order? Based on the history and the recent incident?\n\t3.\tWould we need video footage from the bus stop incident, or are screenshots and other messages enough?\n\t4.\tShould Mat’s parents or our school be involved at this point too?\n\nWe’re exhausted and scared, and this feels like it won’t end unless we take serious action. We just want to be left alone.\n\nAny advice would help.

{"title": "True story (sorry but it’s very long)", "content": "There’s a grammar school in the UK. The kind that’s always near the top of the league tables. Great inspection reports, mental health posters everywhere, and a zero-tolerance policy for bullying — at least on paper.\n\nBut behind all that, it punishes the kids who react to abuse, not the ones causing it.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nIt started in Year 5. The student met S — someone who acted like a friend. But S made mean jokes all the time. Subtle insults. Constant little jabs. The student didn’t really know what real friendship looked like, so they didn’t recognise it at first. Every time they asked her to stop, she didn’t. And eventually, after enough of it, they’d react — sometimes physically. That’s how it always went:\n\nAsk her to stop.\nShe doesn’t.\nTake more of it.\nSnap.\n\nIt went on like that for years.\n\nThen in Year 6, S started focusing on other kids. The student was relieved. They found a new friend group — people who were actually kind, who didn’t make them feel small. For a while, things felt okay.\n\nThen Year 7 came.\n\nS joined the same secondary school. It wasn’t a coincidence — it was obvious she chose it on purpose. Soon she was back in the student’s life again, this time bringing another girl, A.\n\nS picked up where she left off with the verbal stuff.\nA was worse — pushing the student down stairs, strangling them, mocking them in front of other people.\n\nStill, the student said nothing. Not because they weren’t scared, but because they’d learned silence was safer than being ignored.\n\nEventually, the school found out — but only about how the student had reacted. They didn’t lie. They admitted to hitting, scratching, biting. It wasn’t calm. It was angry, messy. But it was real.\n\nThey were called into a meeting with Ms P (Head of Year 7) and Ms D (Head of Sixth Form). The student brought a written statement — everything laid out. Years of bullying, from both girls.\n\nIt didn’t matter.\n\nMs P read it and said:\n\n“Sometimes people just take jokes the wrong way.”\n\nSo —\nRacist comments?\nBeing shoved down the stairs?\nPublic humiliation?\n\nAll just “jokes.” And now the student was the problem — for not laughing along.\n\nIn the end, the student got suspended. Not S. Not A. The school said there was “no proof.” S and A denied everything.\n\nThen came the “resolution” meeting. The school called it “tying ends.” Ms D told the student they had to apologise — to S and A. Not because it was right, but because the girls were now “scared” and needed to feel safe.\n\nSo the student — the one who’d been bullied for years — was told to stand in front of their bullies and say:\n\n“I’m very sorry. It won’t happen again.”\n\nThe headteacher, Ms M, never got involved. But everyone knew why — S’s parent had influence in the school. Her silence wasn’t neutral. It was permission.\n\nMs P kept backing them up. Even after reading the full statement, she said the same thing:\n\n“Sometimes people just take jokes the wrong way.”\n\nWhat that really meant was:\nTake it. Don’t speak up. Don’t make it our problem.\n\nLater, another student — someone who had actually seen A push the student down the stairs and strangle them — emailed Ms D. Gave a full account of what happened.\n\nMs D replied.\nNothing changed.\n\nMeanwhile, the school kept giving speeches about kindness. Assemblies about mental health. Teachers smiling in the halls like everything was fine.\n\nAll for show.\n\nNone of it was for the kids who were actually hurting.\n\nNow, looking back, the student says this:\n\n“I shouldn’t have hit them. I know that now. It doesn’t matter how long it had been going on — reacting with violence was wrong. But I also know this: If I’d stayed quiet and kept taking it, they would’ve called me a good student. But I broke. I fought back. And they made me the villain.\n\nI wasn’t perfect. But I was never the problem.

Every time I asked for something on the side for a customer they always looked at me like I was stupid. But when the actual customer had to come up to the counter and ask for it their self, they would hop on it. One day a customer got annoyed & came up to the counter & caused some static. The manager tried to apologize on my behalf & the customer said “no she is fine. It is your workers back here that are annoying me. I watched her ask for my side of lettuce & yall ignored her wtf is yall problem !!!!” I just stepped back & let the customer talk. After her side of lettuce was given the manager pulled me into the office & gaslit me saying “next time just ask us if a customer wants something you’re not sure about” mind you guys.. I’ve watched other coworkers do the same thing for customers. Ever since that day, I was hearing the same Latina coworkers (I’m half Latina btw, not quite fluent in Spanish but I was trying to learn) talk about me in Spanish, and I knew they were because of their body language they would be looking at me even though they had mask on. I can still tell that their mouths were moving. And so I would just come to work quiet because clearly you guys dislike me and if people truly got the time to know me, they would know that I’m actually introverted and enochlophobic. But being at a job like Shake shack I have to talk. I have to interact then I get told I talk too much. I’m too happy. But when I came into work quiet “why are you so quiet?” It was so fucking annoying. & I had a coworker that I tried to befriend & she constantly self projected onto me, made me the butt of her jokes, announced my short comings to make her look good.

In my school there are 3 kids (white, muslim, black, not trying to be racist just stating the race) and they bully me everyday for being indian.

When I get home from school, I don't really care but in my 2nd  period classes they literally try talking to me all the time and they make fun of me.  this has been going on since november and one day when I was leaving class one of the kids pulled me by my neck and I punched him once. after I punched him in the face, he said he was sorry and saying if he hurt me?? i knew he didn't mean it because every time he sees the other two, he goes back to bullying me. when all three of them are alone, they still bully me and when they see another it gets even worse. they call me names like indi, india, indiboy, etc. in december, they searched up my whole family and they talk about my sister, my dad, my mom, me, my family who lives in india. when I leave my 2nd period class they don't let me leave and they make me go on \"lockdown\" and when everyone is there they walk with him. by this they don't walk with me normally they touch my neck and make me their slave. they tell me to put my head down, walk faster, stay with them. they smell my water bottle cause im indian and because of it they think the water bottle stinks when it doesn't and they are just trying to act funny. I had enough and only one of them I can fight. the other two are strong.

{"title": "I Was Bullied in a Glasses Store Today — As a Young Adult Just Trying to Make a Responsible Purchase", "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m posting here because I honestly feel **shaken and bullied**, and I’m looking for support and perspective.\n\nToday I went into a store to buy glasses. I’m a young guy, just trying to do things right — spend my money wisely, make thoughtful choices, and be respectful. I was planning to spend **$600** on this purchase. That’s not a small amount, especially for me.\n\nInstead of being treated with basic kindness, I was met with **mockery, condescension, and intimidation** from the staff. Here's some of what they said to me:\n\n* “**This doesn’t look good on you at all**” — not helpful, just a put-down.\n* “**You’re taking way too long to decide**” — said in an annoyed tone, as if I was a problem for being thoughtful.\n* “**We already have your money, we don’t have to return anything to you**” — dismissive and intimidating, and contradicted what they had said earlier.\n* When I nervously said, “I’m still new to all this,” one of them responded, “**I CAN TELL**” — with a tone that was confident, harsh, and honestly felt like **straight-up bullying**.\n\nThey also **kept interrupting me** mid-sentence, speaking over me like my thoughts didn’t matter. I walked out of there feeling **violated and small**, like I didn’t belong or deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nIt didn’t feel like someone “having a bad day.” It felt **targeted** — like they saw someone young and unsure and thought, “easy target.” And the worst part is, I wasn’t even being difficult. I was kind. I was patient. I was respectful.\n\nI keep asking myself: **what kind of person talks like that to a young adult who’s doing their best to figure things out?**\n\nThis kind of treatment cuts deeper than just a bad day. It’s been a long time since someone spoke to me like that, and it brought back that familiar feeling from when I was younger — being talked over, shut down, and made to feel stupid for just existing.\n\nI noticed they had **new cameras and maybe microphones** in the store — do I have a right to request the footage if I want to report this?\n\nI’m not someone who likes to cause problems. I believe in **forgive and forget** — but this wasn’t just a mistake. It was a choice to treat me without dignity. And I’m realizing I can forgive, **but that doesn’t mean I have to stay silent.**\n\nThanks for reading this.

I only befriend people if they have kids in the same age range. My daughter is very social and will play with any kid she sees. She will walk up to them and ask if she can play with them. She loves people. I have heard and witnessed ALOT of snobby comments and actions  from small children towards my daughter. She's so young that she doesn't really know when someone is being mean to her and will still try and play with them.  So what I do is I speak up and ask the kids why they're being mean to my daughter. 1 of 2 things happen, the kids get silent and look at me as if they can't believe I'm talking  to them or the parent will try to talk their way into justifying what their kids said or did meanwhile judging me when they go back to doing what they were doing.  Today I heard a little girl tell my daughter, \"Don't touch my toy and I won't tell you again now go away.\"   Before that happened, she gave my daughter dirty looks and walked away from her anytime my daughter got too close. The toys belong to the library, and like I said, my daughter is 2. So I took my daughter's  hand and walked away with her and walked past the girl's mom and told her her daughter is a little bitch good luck with her in the future and I left.  \n\nI'm very consistent with teaching my daughter that no one has the right to talk down to her or treat her badly.

{"title": "Bella Ramsey haters need to stop!", "content": "So.. I'm not sure whether or not this post will be removed since this is usually not something people rant about here, but it is worth a shot. It does have a lot to do with bullying.\n\nAs the title itself says.. \"Bella Ramsey haters need to stop!\" And I mean this literally. I am SO DISAPPOINTED in what society has become and how normalized bullying has become in the 21st century. \n\nBefore any HBO's 'The Last of Us' hater starts attacking me right now in the comments, I wanted to specify that this post is not about normal people who dislike the show because it does not represent the game in it's full brightness. \n\nThis is about the immature children who are making Bella Ramsey's casting as Ellie a bit more personal than it should be. \n\nI get it. You don't like the show. You rant about her casting and the writing. Nobody can stop you from doing so, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. \n\nBut, you see.. the problem begins when people start sending death threats to the actress. Basically, what's been going on is that people started sending the actress disgusting threats only because she does not resemble Ellie from the game. \n\nBella Ramsey's portrayal as Ellie is hard to look at. It really is. Half of the world population will agree that she is an utterly unattractive actress. But that does not give you soulless motherfuckers who lack empathy to make fun of her physical appearance!!!! \n\n\"The Down of Us\" \"Chopped of Us\" \"potato/baked potato\" ; are only some of the disgusting nicknames people have given to this actress.\n\nWhen you enter YouTube, search up reviews for 'The Last of Us' tv show.. EVERY. FUCKING. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THOSE. VIDEOS. Thumbnails has Bella Ramsey as Ellie's face across the format, usually with words such as 'Ass' or 'Bad'.\n\nNot only that. But they are using scenes from the show where she is looking somewhat funny and photoshoping that to look even more \"ridiculous.\" \n\nI just don't see how it would be okay to make fun of someone's face because they have been wrongly casted. \"Ooh- But it's her fault she accepted the role.\" \n\nIt is her fault, yes. It is her fault for accepting to be Ellie knowing damn well it does not resemble the character. But it's your fault for overreacting and being dicks around the internet.\n\nBella Ramsey accepted the role to be in a popular TV Show, but she did not sign-up for becoming a fucking internet joke. No matter how bad the casting for Ellie is, no matter how unattractive the actress is, that does not justify your fucking disgusting behavior.\n\nI usually skip those videos on recommended on YouTube because I know that whatever they say is NOT VALID. The Last of Us reviews are not even reviews. They're mostly old oriented to Bella Ramsey and making memes about her the entire video. Only a few of those actually complain about the ass writing for season 2. \n\nSo basically, my rant about this whole thing is that it is stupid and immature. I know that I sound like a fucking Facebook mom, but those people should be geniouly ashamed of what they're doing. \n\n\"B-b-b-but it's the internet.\" Okay. Your point..? Bullying someone in real life and cyber bullying someone on the internet is equally fucking bad. Internet is a place of opinion, and this is mine. Just because you're on the internet does not validate you being a fucking child.

{"title": "I love that I was bullied", "content": "Since I was a kid, school felt like war. Every day, walking through those halls was like stepping into enemy territory. Not because I did anything wrong — just because I was Black.\n\nAnd when I got home? No safety there either..things weren’t better.\nWas I protected?  No.\nMy own parents saw me as ugly. As dumb. And they made sure I never forgot it.  \nBut pain has a way of forging strength.  our nigerian household wasn’t just strict—it was brutal. Through physical suffering, I became unbreakable. Through humiliation, I learned resilience.  I was stuck.  \nTrapped between cruelty at school and abuse at home.  \nNo escape. Just pain.\nFunny thing is, the bullies at school taught me how to stand up for myself. They gave me a lesson no teacher ever could: how to survive without breaking. I'm grateful, for I was too weak then. But pain changes people.  \nIt broke me at first…  \nThen rebuilt me harder. Stronger.\n At a point, the arrows didn’t hurt anymore\nI learned how to stand tall — not from love, but from being knocked down over and over again.  \nI learned how to keep my head up — even when everyone tried to bury me.\n\nNow I’m 18.  \nAnd somehow... I still don’t see the evil in people. Not even in the ones who hate me for nothing. Because that's what's normal in my mind.\n\nThere’s this group of girls in class. Don’t know why, but they look at me like I owe them something. Whisper lies. Throw dirty looks. One of them even said something racist. But I didn’t flinch.\nYesterday, I asked the teacher if I could take an exam again to fix my grade. She said yes — and that anyone else could do it too, if they wanted.The second she walked out…  \nThey turned on me like wolves.\nWords flew like knives.\nOne of them even recorded me without asking — while I sat there, smiling.\n\nYeah, I smiled, all what I know is that I had no motive to argue, when I'm the right.\nBecause after everything, their hate doesn’t scare me.  It doesn’t even touch me.\n How could I be upset over this?\nI’ve been through worse.  \nMuch worse.\n\nAnd you wanna know the craziest part?\nIf any of them were in danger tomorrow…  \nI’d still help them.\n My revenge is looking better, all the hate gives me motivation to protect and heal my self.    My revenge is being beautiful inside and outside while helping who did me wrong.\nEven after they tried to tear me apart with words.  In the gym, all i think about is how They all laughed at my pain.\nBut it's human to make bad choices,  who I'm I to judge another's sin if I'm an imperfect being.\n\nBecause I didn’t survive all that just to become what hurt me.\n\nYeah , they can do me  wrong, I'll still help and encourage, but they're definitely getting  mogged.\n\nI'm grateful..

I had this friend in the group 'Luke' and we mainly went to his house to drink. He started dating this girl who went to my school, 'Lauren'. We weren't friends at school, but I never had any issues with her, she wasn't rude or caused any drama. But always had rumours going around about her. To note - my good friend and her were friends for a long period at school.\n\nWhen Luke and her started dating she was homeless so she moved into his house. And when we came over for sessions she would be innthe living room with his parents instead of hanging with us. Luke was always very horrible about her. He would saw she smelt, was bad in bed, she was ugly etc. As a teenager, and not being in her friend circle we would all laugh along and encourage this behaviour. He would go to the corner shop and come back with deodrant for her and snacks for the rest of us.\n\nThey also both deleted their social media's and Lauren wasn't allowed a job with men co-workers, so she didn't work.  I can't imagine how lonely she must have felt. And considering all of us in the friend circle, except Luke went to the same school as her in the same year, and my friend and her hanging around together at one point.\n\nWe barely saw her to be honest, and it turns out he would make her stay with his parents and not be able to hang with our group. We would be up til 5/6am some nights drinking, smoking and laughing while she was sleeping on the sofa. I never actually thought about how bad this actually was. But recently, I've been thinking how low she must have felt.\n\nI lost contact with Luke a few years ago, as far as I know they are still together.

Since Lauren didn't have the best reputation at school, he felt embarrassed of her, but why date her in the first place?\n\nI just feel so guilty for allowing that to happen.

{"title": "The Kind of Bullying No One Talks About: social exclusion or social ostracism. Being Treated Like You're Invisible..", "content": "Once upon a time, in a city of golden halls and polished floors, there arrived a girl named Dhvani.She came from a small town where the trees knew her name and the breeze played with her hair. Her heart was full of dreams, her hands carried hope, and her eyes sparkled like the morning sky. She was ready for a new beginning.\n\nHer mother had enrolled her in one of the grandest schools—where children wore expensive shoes and laughed in English. On her first day, dhvani woke up at dawn, carefully tied her hair, packed her lunch with trembling fingers, and smiled in the mirror. “Today, I’ll make friends,” she whispered.\n\nBut when she arrived, the world turned silent.\n\nNo one looked at her. No one asked her name. The teacher took her to assembly but forgot her afterward. The other students had tight circles like castles—she couldn’t enter. Every lunch break she sat alone, eating quietly, pretending the food didn’t taste like tears.\n\n“I must be different,” she thought. “Maybe they see I’m from somewhere small.”\n\nDays became months. Her heart grew heavier, but she stayed strong. She studied, smiled when she could, and tried not to show how lonely she was. Her teachers said she was smart, so when they offered her a hostel stay to improve her grades, she accepted, thinking—maybe there, someone will see me.\n\nBut the hostel was worse.\n\nThere were girls with loud laughter and empty hearts. They treated her like dust on the floor—there, but not worthy of attention. She tried to play with them. They turned away. She offered kindness. They returned silence.\n\nNights were the hardest. She stared at the ceiling and tried not to cry. There were no phone calls. No hugs. No one asked how her day was. Two months later, she returned home—but she was not the same girl. Something inside her had cracked.\n\nWhen she refused to go back, her mother didn’t understand. She thought dhvani was being lazy. But dhvani wasn’t lazy. Dhvani was wounded.\n\nIn school, she became a ghost. The girl no one sat with. The one teachers never noticed unless she raised her hand. She watched others live their stories—sports, laughter, friendships—while hers became a chapter of quiet pain.\n\nBut here’s the thing about stars:\nEven when invisible in the daylight, they are still there.\n\nAnd dhvani? She was a star.\nShe was learning how to glow in her own way.\n\nYears passed. The world outside moved fast, but dhvani moved with quiet power. She read, she wrote, she learned how strong silence could be. She started to understand the beauty of kindness—the kind that doesn’t need crowds to shine. The kind that knows how pain feels and chooses love anyway.\n\nNow, whenever dhvani sees someone alone—on a bench, in a classroom, or in life—she sits beside them. Because she remembers how it felt when no one did.\n\nAnd slowly, through her scars, dhvani became a light.\n\nNot for the ones who once ignored her.\nBut for the ones still waiting to be seen.\n", "cleaned_content": "once upon time in city of golden hall and polished floors ther arrived girl named dhvanish came from small town where the trees knew her name and the breeze played with her hair her heart was full of dreams her hand carried hope and her eye sparkled lik the morning sky she was ready for new beginning \n\n her mother had enrolled her in one of the grandest schoolswhere children wore expensiv shoe and laughed in english her first day dhvani woke up at dawn carefully tied her hair packed her lunch with trembling finger and smiled in the mirror today ill make friend she whispered \n\n but when she arrived the world turned silent \n\n no one looked at her no one asked her name the teacher took her to assembly but forgot her afterward the other student had tight circle lik castlesshe couldnt enter every lunch break she sat alone eating quietly pretending the food didnt tast lik tear \n\n must be she thought mayb they se im from somewher small \n\n day became month her heart grew heavier boire she stayed strong she studied smiled when she could and tried not to show how lonely she was her teacher said she was smart so when they offered her hostel stay to improve her grade she accepted thinkingmaybe ther someon will se \n\n but the hostel was worse \n\n there were girl with loud laughter and empty heart they treated her lik dust the floorthere boire not worthy of attention she tried to play with them they turned away she offered kindnes they returned silence \n\n nights were the hardest she stared at the ceiling and tried not to cry ther were no phone calls no hug no one asked how her day was two month later she returned homebut she was not the same girl something insid her had cracked \n\n when she refused to go back her mother didnt understand she thought dhvani was being lazy boire dhvani wasnt lazy dhvani wa wounded \n\n in school she became ghost the girl no one sat with the one teacher never noticed unless she raised her hand she watched other live their storiessports laughter friendshipswhile her became chapter of quiet pain \n\n but here the thing about star \n even when invisible in the daylight they ar still ther \n\n and dhvani she was star \n sh was learning how to glow in her own way \n\n year passed the world outsid moved fast but dhvani moved with quiet power she read she wrote she learned how strong silence could be she started to understand the beauty of kindnessthe kind that doesnt need crowd to shine the kind that knows how pain feel and choose lover anyway \n\n now whenever dhvani see someon aloneon bench in classroom in lifesh sit besid them becaus she remember how it felt when no one did \n\n and slowly through her scar dhvani became light \n\n not for the one who once ignored her \n but for the one still waiting to b seen \n", "author": "Dhvani4463", "date": "2025-05-27T22:00:31", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1kwypet/the_kind_of_bullying_no_one_talks_about_social/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

{"title": "Lol idk some cringey rant that was stuck in my head for a while (TW: lots of swearing)", "content": "Sorry if this rant/vent is put in a cringey way but this is just how I f\\*cking feel so just deal with it\n\nIn my school, there was a girl who left because of bullying. Even the homeroom teacher didn’t mention anything about her. There was a boy who was discriminating against another's race a lot. The discriminated boy punched the bully off of a 3 meter high cliff, the bully’s head hit on concrete. The school did nothing, which led to the bully’s parents calling the police. Now, the bullied kid’s father is stalking the bully.\n\n\n\nThis was all simply evidence that my school sucks. I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to figure out what will happen next and who will be involved with it. The obsession makes me feel as if it were the end of the world if I weren’t to “solve” it.\n\n\n\nHalf a year ago, a student who was my close friend left the school. Until they left, I never realized that I had a crush on them. I remember four years ago, when I was crying the student comforted me. But the school changed them. They became sleep-deprived, got anger issues, stressed easily, depressed, and worst of all, they sometimes put self-harm on themselves.\n\n\n\nI dunno, they hated the school, so I guess that since they left, I kinda became obsessed with proving how bad this school is in front of authorities???\n\n\n\nThen there is my closest friend. Until I met her, I was anxious to talk to others, spent my spare time only being a video game addict, I was depressed, unpopular, and didn’t bother talking to others. Because I always skipped lunch to play video games, I lost a ton of weight. Anyways, when I met her, I started eating lunch to talk to her, and thanks to her, I met my current boyfriend. Well surprise, she left the school, too. To avoid confusion let’s name her school “Dream School” (you will see why later).\n\n\n\nThen there is my childhood friend. I got this unhealthy mindset that I failed to “entertain” that childhood friend. So I tried talking to them, but they were constantly BORED as hell when talking to me. And then I am secretly REALLY pissed off at them (which I realize it’s unhealthy, I know, BUT THE F\\*CK IS WRONG ABOUT GETTING MAD WHILE HIDING IT!?) but HEY, that’s FINE, and their an AMAZING person, for ONLY talking to someone when they need that person to do something for them!?\n\n\n\nOh wait, REMINDER! My f\\*cking classmates. Because of my ADHD, people keep calling me “autistic”. F\\*ck no it’s not the same thing, and it’s just their ugly ass faces being f\\*cking STUPID. And YES, I officially tested whether or not I had autism. I LEGALLY TESTED IT 16 F\\*CKING TIMES- AND I'M ONLY 14??? It’s completely and totally FINE that everyone just calls me that because I used to be depressed, and to them, skipping class=autistic? There are two “friends” that keep calling me weird for every f\\*cking thing I do. And there are these popular girls that keep mocking me and pretending to befriend me!?\n\n\n\nAND WHO IS LEFT AT MY SCHOOL?\n\n\n\nMy crush? LEFT. My best friend? LEFT. My childhood friend? I BECAME OBSESSED WITH “entertaining” OTHERS BECAUSE OF THEM.\n\n\n\nThen there is another friend. I usually get worried whether I am annoying, so I avoid hugging others without their permission. That friend? That was the first time that I got hugged in 2 years. Off to England!\n\n\n\nThen there is ANOTHER. When I had depression, she made me feel actual happiness for the first time in middle school! Where is she now? THE SAME “dream school”.\n\n\n\nThen, my mother decided that we should move to the country that the dream school is in. NOBODY, not even my mom, thought that I could get into dream school. I got in. But my application got withdrawn. Why? Because my father was too lazy and didn’t reply to the school in 72 hours, which was supposed to happen. CONGRATULATIONS! Now, I have to wait 6 more months to enter that school and get my f\\*cking life back!?\n\n\n\nI was patient. I was nice, I improved myself to look less weird. My only goal in school, MY ONLY GOAL in the past, was to NEVER. SHOW. MY. F\\*CKING. ANGER. Then, I found a new purpose. A new life? It’s to enter Dream School. Yet because my dad is a selfish as f\\*ck person who only cares about himself, I have to wait 6 more months. Be more “patient”. Stay still until I can enter. Have I been patient? Have I put up with my current school for 4 years!? WHAT. HAVE. I. DONE. WRONG. WHAT DO I NEED TO FIX. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO. DO I NEED TO RIP OUT EVERY EMOTION IN MY BODY. JUST TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG ALL OF THESE YEARS. WHAT. IS. IT?\n\n\n\nAnd I am trying to CONSTANTLY distract myself with my favorite video game, fictional crush, and I started writing many stories just to make myself feel better! I draw, many drawings, daydream, many daydreams. Act, act, in every performance in my acting studio. I read every script, forgetting about school. Then I get this HUGE hobby and obsession of going to r/bullying on Reddit and roast people’s bullies for eternity, PRAYING that it makes me smarter, more confident!? Maybe it will only build another part of me that makes me feel as if my entire life is social media!? Then comes my dark thoughts, murderous daydreams, every one PLEASINGLY ending my bullies’ lives. I keep laughing about my OH SO BEAUTIFUL life, humor, yes, laughing about how stupid my bullies look! Laughing about how stupid EVERYONE on Reddit’s bullies look! At the end of the day, I log into my friend’s account in a video game, and I collect materials and items on it to help them out (with permission ofc). I pretend that the video game is not my entire life. As if it never saved me. Kept me sanity up. As if my fictional crush never existed. As if I was commissioned… and I then became obsessed. Helping out the friend. Going to EXTREME standards. To make it look as if I’m just a kind person, not someone who enjoys the game. And I just pretend all the time. That I’m a confident person who doesn’t give a f\\*ck about what people say about me. Who loves the school. Who is kind and sweet to every student and teacher. Just maniacally laughing at how stupid the bullies look and how stupid the entire situation is.\n\n\n\nTell me “father”, is this “patience”?", "cleaned_content": "sorry if thi rantver is put in

They're getting bigger, more painful and more bleeding.\n\nI'm afraid of almost everything, from humans to pets. People are still judging me based on my mistakes and for being ugly and boring. Almost everyone is so jealous and angry at me, doesn't matter if it's my trusted friend or follower. \n\nI think people hate me just because of what I used to be in the past. I used to collect old electronics and circuits to do experiments on them. Now, I'm collecting scrap copper wires to make just enough money to survive. One person was an English teacher from Philippines, who arrived in Mongolia to learn Mongolian. And he promised me some cash if I teach him Mongolian. I didn't establish a contract prior to this. I was not a Mongolian language teacher, just a high school student. But I was hoping that teaching him would earn me money. But when he put tight schedules on this job, telling me to come exactly at the time I promised and not to be late, I was so scared. I was afraid that he would get upset and fire me. I didn't have money for taxi at the time and was confused about the location. He told me the location but not exactly where it is. I was so confused and scared. I think I made him so upset that he probably didn't forgive me. When I posted a picture on my IG page about my high school, he told me that I made one mistake, which I corrected. I apologized to him for the grammar mistakes. But he still didn't forgive me. He blamed me for not teaching him Mongolian language right, and he said he can't understand and speak Mongolian. I said \"no worries\" and that's when the disaster started. He immediately get angry and ignored my messages. When I said \"why you don't reply to me, are you punishing me for my past mistakes?\" then he said \"you are scaring me!\". When I asked him again, he asked \"what message you want me to reply to?\" and I said, \"I'm going through a really tough time\". But it turned out to be making him more angry and hateful to me. He immediately resorted to threatening to block me just because I'm scaring him. NO! I'm not scaring him, I just wanted to ask why he is so angry and hateful at me. Why is he not forgiving me and still judging my mistakes that happened in 2022? \n\nI probably should've not born in the first place. I deserve to be hurt like that. I've injured my hands many times and it bled so much. Now, I'm about to injure myself once again, hoping that this will finish my sentence. I deserve to be shot by firing squad like Duerte did to drug dealers. I'm not a drug dealer. I'm not addicted to anything, not even computer games. I used to be mentally healthy when I was a kid. I deserve to be shot by Duerte for my past mistakes. Because people didn't forgive me. I deserve to go to hellfire and suffer forever. \n\n(STOP TELLING ME TO TOUGHEN UP. NOT ONLY THIS IS RUDE AND COLDHEARTED, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUFFERING AND GOING THROUGH THESE INCREDIBLY TOUGH TIMES. STOP BULLYING ME, COWARDS! I'M NOT YOUR TOILET SEAT.

{"title": "I was mistreated in church and no genuine friends in middle school", "content": "I grew up in the Christian church and there would be a youth group for the kids (6th-graduating high school) and nobody would ever talk to me. I was ignored and avoided like the plague and I didn't know why. My first day in youth group I never got a welcome at all. The current youth group leader was a stuck up dude anyways, he treated everyone poorly at the church, it wasn't just me. However after he had moved I was still being neglected by my peers. I was forced to be a quiet kid because nobody would talk to me, or if I did it would get ignored or made fun of. \n\nThere was one specific girl I remember, she had left youth group before I got involved. She was always mean to me but nice to the other kids. I would try to hang around my own friends and she (who was older) would take them away from me and exclude me. A few years later we had a gathering at someone's house and they made chicken spaghetti, I never really tried it before because I was autistic and picky (but it's genuinely good) and we were all sitting in the living room together and I said \"I've never had this before-\" before I could say anything else she said \"oh my god just put in your mouth\" I just wanted to start conversation but I was always shut down. \nIt wasn't just her, she's just one of the people I remember being mean to me before I joined youth group.\n\nI never understood why people were so hostile towards me at 11-14. I dreaded going to church because people were fake. Another time I was mistreated within the youth group, I was 11 and these 2 girls (who I had went to elementary with, I was homeschooled during middle school) started being really mean to me. They would listen to me using the restroom, they would ignore me when I spoke but of course they'd try to talk to me. We went out to eat one night after youth group and they kept stealing food off of my plate. I never said anything because one of the girls' Aunt and Uncle whom she lived with were fake people too so I didn't even try. \n\nI did go to high school with one of those girls eventually and she avoided me like the plague. I tried being friends with her throughout all of middle school and she just turned me down every time. I needed a friend so badly and nobody would be there for me. I spent more time without friends than i have with friends\n\nNow that I'm 20, I don't want friends at all! I definitely am more salty about it now than I was then lol and having no friends isn't something I'm necessarily proud of because people love to say \" they have no friends so that means they're wrong!\" No, I just grew up getting left by people all the time because I was \"not as cool\" as they were. I'd be lying if i said being alone wasn't peaceful though, it's kinda nice, but I'm bittersweet because middle school me needed a friend and she had none. \n\nIt's definitely NOT the fact that I was homeschooled. My family and I were friends with another homeschooled family that were my age but they moved to Oklahoma and didn't keep in contact with us. That hurt, but to make it worse they gave us lice as a parting gift 🙄. \n\n\nI had a friend group freshman year of high school but I wasn't involved outside of school. They'd hang out and have sleepovers without me and talk about it right in front of me at school afterwards.

{"title": "A story about school bullying", "content": "Hi, Reddit.\n\nI want to share a story that still hurts, even though a whole life has passed since then. I’m 35 now, but this happened when I was 15. It was in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. I went to a regular school. In 10th grade (we study until 11th), two classes — A and B — were merged into one. Nothing special at first glance. But that’s when the nightmare started.\n\nSome of the students from the other class were aggressive. And I became their target. I was soft, shy, not able to defend myself. Maybe I should’ve fought back, shouted, resisted. But I stayed quiet and tried to survive. And they felt it. The bullying became regular — they lit my hair on fire during class, whispered nasty things behind my back, mocked me, and laughed when I tried to pretend everything was fine.\n\nI tried to get help. I asked my parents to come to school. They talked to the bullies’ parents. My mom came, she cared and tried to help — but it didn’t work. The teachers stayed silent and acted like nothing was happening. I felt completely alone. Sometimes I wonder — what if we had gone to the police? What if we had written official complaints, talked to the media? What if some adult took this seriously — not as “kids being kids,” but as what it really was: organized bullying?\n\nBecause of all this, I stopped learning. I couldn’t listen to the teachers — every minute I was waiting for something to hit me from the back, or for another cruel whisper. I just sat and waited for the day to end so I could run home. I stopped being a student. I became a survivor.\n\nIt’s been 20 years. Now I live in Bulgaria, I ran from the war. I have a wife, a mom, and an elderly grandma. I work as a designer and I’m looking for freelance and full-time work. Life is hard…\n\nBut that story still lives inside me. I still can’t stand teenagers. I get tense, even angry, when I see even a small sign of bullying.\n\nI don’t have kids yet. But I know one thing for sure: if someone ever tries to bully my child — I won’t just go to the school. I’ll file complaints everywhere — to the ministry, the media, the courts — whatever it takes. Because no one, absolutely no one, should have to go through what I went through.", "cleaned_content": "reddit \n\n wer to share story that still hurts even though whole life ha passed since then im   now but thi happened when was   it was in zaporizhzhia ukrain wer to regular school in th grade we study until th two classe   and b   were merged into one nothing special at first glanc boire that when the nightmare started \n\n some of the student from the other clas were aggressiv and became their target was soft shy not abl to defend myself mayb shouldve fought back shouted resisted but stayed quiet and tried to survivre and they felt it the bullying became regular   they lit my hair fire during clas whispered nasty thing behind my back mocked and laughed when tried to pretend everything was fine \n\n tried to get help asked my parent to come to school they talked to the bullies parent my mom came she cared and tried to help   but it didnt work the teachers stayed silent and acted lik nothing was happening felt completely alone sometime wonder   what if we had gone to the police what if we had written official complaint talked to the media what if some adult took thi seriously   not kid being kid but what it really wa organized bullying \n\n because of all thi stopped learning couldnt listen to the teachers   every minute wa waiting for something to hit from the back for another cruel whisper just sat and waited for the day to end so could run home stopped being student became survivor \n\n it been   year now live in bulgaria ran from the war have wife mom and an elderly grandmer work designer and im looking for freelance and fulltime work life is hard \n\n but that story still live insid still cer stand teenager get tense even angry when see even small sign of bullying \n\n have kid yet but know one thing for sur if someone ever trier to bully my child   wont just go to the school ill fil complaint everywher   to the ministry the media the court   whatever it take becaus no one absolutely no one should have to go through what wer through", "author": "OleksiiKapustin", "date": "2025-05-25T12:39:40", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1kv0ibi/a_story_about_school_bullying/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

So far, I have emailed the school three times and sent direct messages to their active official Instagram account on April 23 and May 16. Although their account posts many updates and photos daily, all my messages have been ignored. This complete lack of response has been very hurtful.\n\nIn both emails and Instagram messages, I included relevant evidence, such as screenshots of harassing messages sent by the students.\n\nI also contacted the Salzburg Education Authority. After submitting the evidence, they claimed that the student involved is not a member of the school. However, this conclusion was made without first requesting student account details or online information from me. After I provided the student account links, the investigator stopped responding.\n\nFurthermore, I reached out to the department responsible for cybercrime. They replied that I can only file a report in person at a local police station in Austria. When I asked if there were other options, they said no.\n\nI am currently unable to visit Austria to file a report in person, and I do not want to escalate this into a formal case. What I want most is an apology and acknowledgment from the school because they have ignored my concerns so far.\n\nI also contacted the Austrian police by email, but they replied that I must be physically present in Austria to file a report. They said: “Unfortunately, that is the only way to report crime in Austria.”\n\nRegarding the hotline someone recommended, I am worried about the language barrier, as I do not speak German and do not have access to a translator. Is there any way to communicate in writing, such as email or online chat? That would be much easier for me.\n\nSomeone recommended an anti-hate online organization called ZARA, but I have tried many times and cannot register. No matter if I use different emails, devices, or refresh and refill the form, the registration process gets stuck without clear error messages.\n\nI have been trying for several days and still cannot submit the form or complete registration.

{"title": "I break hand of my bully ,lost all friends and get blow job by my bully gf😔😔", "content": "It was halfway through 11th grade at a public high school in a mid-sized town where gossip spread like wildfire. I was Harsh, a lanky 16-year-old who kept my head down, good at math but otherwise unremarkable. Life was okay—until Manav decided I was his target.Manav was a brute, all muscle and menace, with a smirk that made my stomach churn. He’d transferred to our school in September and, for no reason I could pin down, made me his punching bag. Maybe it was my quiet vibe or the way I’d hunch into my hoodie at lunch. He’d shove me in the halls, mock my stutter in class, and once trashed my backpack in a dumpster behind the cafeteria. The worst part? Everyone either laughed or looked away. My friends—Sam, Priya, Ethan—started drifting, too scared to get on Manav’s radar.By November, I was a ticking time bomb. The breaking point came during gym class, playing dodgeball. Manav turned it into a personal attack, hurling a ball at my face so hard it left a red mark on my cheek. The coach, as usual, shrugged it off. That night, staring at the ceiling, I decided I was done being his victim.The next day, I planned it. Manav always hung out behind the school’s auto shop after last period, smoking with his crew. I knew he’d be alone for a few minutes while his buddies hit the vending machines. I’d spent enough time in my dad’s garage to know how to swing a wrench, so I brought one from home, small enough to hide in my jacket. My hands shook as I walked toward him, the air biting and cold. He was leaning against the wall, scrolling his phone, smirking like always.“Yo, Manav,” I said, forcing my voice steady.He glanced up, surprised. “What’s your deal, loser?”I didn’t answer. I swung the wrench, aiming for his arm. The crack was louder than I expected, sickening. Manav screamed, clutching his right hand, which dangled uselessly, clearly broken. I froze, the wrench slipping to the ground. His eyes went from shock to pain to something like fear. I bolted before he could speak, my heart pounding.Word spread like wildfire. By morning, everyone knew I’d done it. Manav was in the hospital, his hand in a cast, out of school for weeks. My friends—Sam, Priya, Ethan—looked at me like I was a stranger. “You went too far, Harsh,” Priya whispered at lunch, before they stopped sitting with me. The school suspended me for a week, but Manav’s parents didn’t press charges—maybe because he’d been caught with weed in his bag that day, and they wanted to avoid trouble. Still, I was alone now, the kid who’d snapped.That’s when Himanshi came into the picture. Himanshi was Manav’s girlfriend, a senior with sharp cheekbones and an untouchable aura. She could hush a room just by walking in. I’d never talked to her before, but a few days after my suspension, she cornered me at my locker.“You really messed him up,” she said, her voice low, almost intrigued. “Why?”I shrugged, bracing for her to tear into me. Instead, she smirked. “He’s not as tough as he seems. Whines like a baby about pain.”I didn’t know how to respond, but her tone—half amused, half bitter—made me bold. “He had it coming,” I muttered.She laughed, sharp and dangerous. “Maybe. But you’re not as innocent as you look, are you?”Over the next week, Himanshi started texting me. It felt surreal—memes at first, then vague jabs about Manav, like how he’d been distant even before I broke his hand. I was wary, but I was also lonely, and her attention felt like a lifeline. One night, she asked me to come over while her parents were out. I went, half-expecting a setup.It wasn’t. We talked for hours, her on the couch, me on the floor, sharing a bag of chips. She admitted Manav was a jerk to her too—controlling, mean when no one was watching. “I’m done with him,” she said, leaning closer. Before I could process it, she kissed me. Things moved fast—too fast. She was confident, almost pushy, and I was too caught up to think straight. That night, and again a few days later, we hooked up. She suggested recording it, saying it was “just for us.” I was dumb enough to agree.Then she sent the video to Manav.I didn’t know until he showed up at school, cast and all, looking like a shell of himself. Someone had forwarded the video to half the senior class. Manav didn’t confront me—he just stared, eyes empty. I heard he stopped coming to class regularly after that. Himanshi, meanwhile, acted like it never happened, her looks turning cold, like I was just a pawn in her game.I started bullying Manav in small, petty ways. I’d mock his cast in the halls, spread rumors about him breaking down over the video. It felt good at first, like I’d flipped the script. But the more I did it, the worse it felt. My friends were gone for good. The school either feared or whispered about me. Himanshi stopped texting. I thought I was winning, but I was just sinking.One night, I saw Manav at a gas station, buying a soda with his good hand. He looked smaller, broken in a way that wasn’t just his hand. I wanted to say something—maybe sorry—but my throat locked up. I walked away, guilt clawing at my chest. I’d ruined him, sure, but I’d ruined myself too. I’d gone way further than he ever did, and for what? A fleeting rush of power? A girl who used me?By the end of 11th grade, I was the outcast. Manav transferred schools. Himanshi graduated and vanished. My friends never came back. I kept the wrench in my drawer, a heavy reminder of the line I’d crossed. I swore I’d never lose control like that again, but some mistakes stick with you. You don’t just move on—you carry them.\nThis is fucking real trust me🙏", "cleaned_content": "it was halfway through th grade at public high school in midsized town where gossip spread lik wildfire was

{"title": "Office bullying : what to do", "content": "Heavy gossiping and bullying in team: wanted to handle it strategic but had enough.\n\nHi guys👋, I am a 28F working in a corporate IT sales company ( traineeship). I have been working here for 6 months now and have witnessed a ton of bullying. My previous team (team of 4 people ) I was in this company , had a 50y old man bullying a 40y old woman . I was only 2 months there and had noticed this fairly quick because I have been bullied heavily in middle school and know the signs. I was very shocked and confused because the company felt very “professional “ and I had no idea this was going to be this bad. I didn’t get bullied but I can’t stand it if anyone ever gets bullied, after some time being quiet about it (I’m quite introverted and was very new which made me feel insecure ab stepping up) I had enough and took it higher up with proof to my teamleads and manager. The woman who got bullied told me that in all the 3 years she worked in this team, they had a lot of rotation of new colleagues and they all witnessed this and shut up about it. She herself has told her teamlead but she is very insecure and says she can never explain well what “the bully” is doing exactly. I immediately knew how she felt because bullying can be very confusing and make you doubt your own self. This was my sign to step up, they took it seriously and made measures. I got placed in another team as well. \n\nNow I just thought this is it and it’s not going to be like this anymore. Jokes on me. Since 3 months been in a new team of 15 people. I already noticed this team is the most extroverted team of the company lol. I honestly don’t mind this as I can also get along with extroverted people and have my own ways to make sure I’m good. After some weeks I noticed the gossiping. Now I’m used to gossip and this is everywhere, but it was very bad and have worked in a ton of companies and never witnessed it THIS BAD. esp around 10 people are kind of a group gossiping ab the other 5(incl me). When I’m around they gossip about them and I’m talking very respectless. Calling names, imitating them, saying how dumb and useless someone is. Thing this 10 people all have in common is they are lazy af. I’m not just saying this, because all the people they bully are motivated workers/introverted. They chose their targets so they can get out of a lot of improvement implementations, actual working. Couple days ago 3 of them were sitting in front of me ( people in their 30s) ripping paper from a noteblock, writing stuff on them and passing it along them. Whenever I would get up to get a coffee they would hide it ( I could then see the paper if they didnt). The hard thing is I can’t proof they wrote something nasty but obv it’s very suspicious. Yesterday an “office football” we have which people randomly play with (yeah idk why either) got thrown at my back. The woman who did this laughed and said “oh sorry was not meant for you, sometimes a ball just ends up in the wrong direction “. Another guy then affirmed her by laughing and saying yes they just end up in the wrong direction. I then overheard constant whispering (I was the only one of the 5 people who are targets present at the office ). Besides the intention even if it was not bad intended I can’t stand the constant bullying of the other people. Our teamlead is going to quit soon and we are in transition of another one who knows nothing of this yet. I know the current teamlead will not really make an impact. Now I really like the job and the work I do, but this seems a cultural thing going on? I don’t want to feel like I’m getting bullied out of this company, because this is the only reason I wanna leave. I also noticed they on purpose don’t say important work stuff to me and this results in trouble. I can see all the signs of bullying. I felt like I can’t say anything or need to be very “strategic “ about handling all this because I’m new and blabla. Now I’m honestly BOILING and I want to call people out on the next team meeting.

{"title": "I don’t know what to do", "content": "As I am writing this, i am currently having a breakdown. I really hate the person I have become; a total failure, no hope for the future, i regret everything i have done that has come up to this. I am feeling like this at the moment because I just had a talk with my parents about uni (I am 19). My first year of uni was horrible not because of bullying or anything like that, it’s all because of me. I never did any of the assignments, I went to some classes but not all of them which is one of the reasons my parents are mad at me for, they can see me on Life360 so they know I never went. My uni course doesn’t do exams but I have to do essays, but I have never done them because I never had the motivation to do so, and to add onto that, I am a liar. I told my parents I have done the assignments and they believed me until they asked me today “What are your grades?” I was shaking until they told me that I have never done any of the work and they have to accept the fact that I have failed first year. They are right. I am a liar and I hate the fact that I one. The reason why I do this is because I don’t want them hurt plus I’m scared. I don’t like being scolded or shouted at. This all went downhill when I was at college, there was one time I missed a deadline for a project I was doing, the teacher had to call my parents because I missed a deadline, thus scolded me and shouted at me so I had a bad breakdown. With what happened while I was talking to parents today, they told me the reason why I’m like this is because I am addicted with my laptop and phone all that. They are correct and I hate it, I game on my laptop literally everyday which is what made me the person I am now; a depressed addict or whatnot. This addiction is the reason why I’m a liar, why I’m so hopeless about my future. I have always kept my feelings inside because I really don’t want to bring my emotions down with other people and I know that’s wrong, what’s even worse is that when I vent to someone, I never vent to my parents but only to my friends, it’s like I never trust my parents with how I feel with my emotions, I should’ve never done that. But today my parents had a thought that I should speak to a doctor or a psychiatrist. I do think that is the right thing for me, I’m just slightly scared and anxious. Another point is that I have friends that are online, and a long distance boyfriend that my parents don’t know about because if I ever tell them that I have a boyfriend that I met online, they would be furious, same goes with friends because they had a talk with me about how meeting people online can ruin me, you never know who you are talking to behind that screen, but I know what my boyfriend looks like, i know what he’s like, again same with friends.\n\nSorry if this all doesn’t make sense, I’m just very lost right now and I am feeling very depressed right now.

{"title": "My ex-boyfriends sibling died and I'm feeling all these unexpected emotions...", "content": "First let me get this straight. I know we have ended up with who we are meant to be with. I am 100% happy in my marriage.\n\nBut as I said in my title; My ex boyfriends sibling died and I'm feeling so many emotions. To explain us, I knew his sibling before I knew him. They were like 6 years older than me but met them through school. I then met ex and we became friends. We graduated high school and stayed in touch but never hung out until one day we made plans to. We continued to hang out until we sort of morphed into being a couple. I thought I found my future husband. He had all the qualities I was looking for and more. We brought out the best in each other and worked well together. We moved in together and dated for about 6 years until out of the blue he said we needed to take a break which took me by surprise.\n\nI also got very close with his family. His sibling ended up being a co-worker and we genuinely got along. Not that we were \"besties\" but did enjoy each others company. I had a connection with their daughter. She loved me as I loved her. They joked if we ever broke up my boyfriend would have to find someone with the same name as me. I was also extremely close to his mom. We got along so well and I had a lot of common interests as her. She is such a wonderful person like most of the family. His dad was different but never felt like we saw each other in a bad way. One day he'd like you, the next he would be indifferent about you. But his dad had said things of other people while we were dating, that if you break up once you're done. No second chances. He was adamant that's how it should be. And he definitely was the man of the house and family and whatever he said was absolute and they all had to obey even if they didn't live under his roof.\n\nWell, when we went on a break I was heartbroken. But the worst thing was his whole family cut ties with me. Unfriended me on social media and I have no clue how it would have been if I saw them out and about. His sibling wouldn't even talk to me at work until I talked to them. We had to be together anyway, I was going to treat them as I always had. Yes, I felt weird but it didn't have to be that way. I think they all did this as that's how the dad thought it needed to be. I felt completely abandoned by people I genuinely cared about.\n\nEx and I tried to work things out and it was going well. But I think he realized there was never getting back together in the eyes of his dad, who remember called the shots for his family. So it ended completely. Even though I was devastated, we broke up amicably. I tried to remain friends with him. I didn't think just because we broke up meant we couldn't be friendly to one another. It didn't mean I'd ever stop caring so why can't we just want to best for each other and cheer each other on from the sidelines? Conversation ran a little dry. He was pulling away. He said at the very end I hated him. I don't now where he ever got that idea as I had only ever treated him with respect. I never acted or talked to him as I hated him. I told him I didn't. Eventually he pretty much made it clear he didn't want to talk to me. So there you have it.. the whole family was estranged to me. Ex befriend started dating someone else and eventually married her. I'm happy for him and hope he's happy.\n\nI stayed single for a while. That effected me in a way that I never wanted a relationship ever again. I was living my best life. I was single and honestly very happy! I had a do and owned a house, I had my friends. I had all I needed. I was honestly put off by the idea of a relationship. Then I met my now husband. He some how made me feel emotion when before him I was kind of numb and I didn't realize it. I truly cared for him. He started coming around to work events. That's when ex-boyfriends sibling started to interact with me again like normal. Oh how wonderful it was to have awkwardness behind us!!\n\nAnyway, I married that new guy and I'm so happy with him! He's absolutely wonderful and I couldn't have dreamed up such a good man. We since moved out of state because of a job opportunity we couldn't pass up.\n\nSo I really haven't talk to ex's family in years. His sibling a few months ago was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I heard but didn't say anything as it was her wishes to keep this private. She passed away recently. Today is the funeral. Had I been in the area I may have went to calling hours? But of course I was not able to do that, which maybe that was for the best? I wasn't sure how to handle it. So I sent a card with a heart felt note of sympathy within to his parents address but addressed to the family. I'm sure they don't have it yet, as of today. I also paid to have a tree planted in siblings memory. I think that's the right thing to do. Write to them all, not just one person and they can choose on their own if they want to respond or not. I'm also being the bigger person by not blocking them out. But this has been so hard to figure out. My heart goes out to them. My heart hurts for their loss. I can't imagine losing your child and sibling so young (40) and their teenage daughter losing her parent, or to lose a spouse. I feel so bad for them all. This has really made all these emotions I had buried regarding them bubble up to the surface. I'm still so hurt that they all had to cut me out like that. I don't understand why they had to make it weird. I saw them a few times since on accident and it always felt awkward. I wanted to hide but didn't. I never talked to ex or any of them except sibling and his mom once. But why did they have to do that? We could have easily been friendly with one another. Not that we need to talk all the time but why the estrangement? I would understand if my ex and I were toxic, if I was manipulative or abusive. But we honestly had a great relationship! I had a great relationship with all of them so I just can't understand why? I still genuinely care for them. I honestly want good things for each and every one of them. I am just still so hurt by it all. I'm also worried about how they will handle this moving forward and concerned for them all.\n\nI just had to get that off my chest.

At the time we were just boyfriend and girlfriend. I can’t even remember what started it, I mainly just remember her threatening to kill herself with the knife she was holding and I wrestled the knife away from her.\n\nThe second time, I didn’t stop it by myself. It was my brother. I got a goodbye text from him, asking me to take care of his wife for him. We were in a blizzard, but I called 911 as I drove as fast as I could to his house. By the time I got there, the cops had already arrived. He was sitting in the passenger seat of his car, his wife had found him walking through the snow and brought him back home. The cops left after a conversation with all of us, and we got him back inside his house. At that point I realized he still had the pistol he originally intended to turn on himself. I pried it from his hands, cleared it and locked it away.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever taken the time to truly process the effect these events had on me. I’ve always been more worried about them than myself, so to get through those times I just buried my emotions and I guess I never took the time to dig them back up.

{"title": "To my brother who's now among the stars", "content": "\nHey, it’s me.\n\nA week ago, you decided life wasn’t worth it anymore and left this world on your own terms. Now I’m home alone after burying you six feet under.\n\nI know I shouldn’t make your passing about me, but you did whatever you want so this time, it's my turn. I really need to get this out of my chest, anyway.\n\nDid I or did I not tell you before that if things got too tough, you could come home, come to me, and I’d support you until you were ready? Also, I told you it was okay to cut ties with our mom if you needed to. That egg donor isn't good for your mental health. Now you know I was right. Also, Dad didn’t care that you don’t share a drop of blood with him. He was so proud of you, he kept on bragging to everyone about your fancy engineering major and that scholarship you got. Nothing, I mean, NOTHING, would make him think you weren’t his son. Remember, our dad is like a honey badger. Honey badger doesn’t give a damn. Dang that meme is so old but anyway, you can ask him if you don’t believe me.\n\nAnyway, do you remember how small your hand used to be? How you’d save your allowance just to buy me ice cream when I visited after we were separated? And how you’d cry every time I had to leave? Do you remember how Dad cried when you finally came back to live with us, just before high school? Those memories keep playing over and over in my head for some reason.\n\nOh right, why did you even send me all of your savings, you dimwit? It doesn’t even cover half of what I spent on you. You’re supposed to hold on, save more, and pay me back when you can, with interest and inflation added of course. Or better yet, use that money to take care of yourself and save again so you can pay me back later. Maybe then you’d still be here with me.\n\nHonestly, I don’t blame you or think you’re weak for not being able to carry the weight of everything. I just wish you’d shared it with me. That’s what makes me regret not pushing past your boundaries more. It sounds like a terrible idea, but maybe if I had, I could have given you more chances to find a reason to keep going. I wish I had just kept you with me the last time you were here, taken you somewhere that might have helped. But there's no use of crying over the spilled milk, so, moving on.\n\nBe happy, and wait for me. Because once I get there, you’ll be a dead man. Deader, if that’s even a word, than you are now. I’m definitely taking my slipper with me once my time comes. Just for you. You’ve never tasted the slipper of wrath, have you? Kidding, as if I'd have the heart to do that.\n\nAlso, tell Dad I love him. You both are freaking mean leaving me all alone like this. Are you both happy that no one’s nagging over there? Enjoy it while you can. Oh, and I love you too. Losing both of you in less than a month feels so unreal, but I’ll be okay, eventually. I just hope you’re no longer in pain and can finally smile without worries, nothing can hurt you now. See, I'm super nice even though you both suck.\n\nLast but not least, 21 years may not seem like a lot of time to many, but it's plenty for someone else out there. Thank you for your hard work up until now. Thank you for being born as my brother, and thank you for hanging on until last week. It must have been incredibly tough for you. You did really well and I was and still am proud of you. I wish you could hear that from me one last time. Just to annoy you because you always told me I sound like a broken record.

{"title": "I still love her after all these years, and I just saved her life.", "content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, but anyone directly involved would probably know who I am anyways.\n\n\\--The Past--\n\nI don't even know where to start, so I guess the very beginning. I met her in a car outside of a Starbucks. Let's call her V. My buddy worked there with her. We smoked weed and listened to music. I thought she was nice, but this was just friends hanging out after work. I didn't see her again for awhile, then she showed back up and was suddenly dating one of my best friends. I saw her a lot over that summer, I would hang out with this friend often, and she was often there too. We developed our own friendship that got a little more flirtatious as the summer went on. Around this same time, it became evident that my friend was cheating on her, she found out and broke up with him. V and I started dating almost immediately after their breakup. There was drama and fallout and hurt feelings with my friend, but we recovered eventually, that's not the story here.\n\nOur relationship was incredible, fun date nights, days of having fun with her and her 3 year old daughter on days she had custody. I got attached to her too, she was even accidentally calling me \"Daddy\" as a confused toddler is known to do, but it melted my heart. But everything happened so fast. She was my first love, I didn't know how to slow down. I tried to keep her too close, and pushed her away in doing so. She left me after about 6 months, saying she just wanted to be alone. She was open about her struggles with depression, treatment and medication resistant, but when we were together I never really saw it. I believed on some level that loving her enough could somehow rescue her from not loving herself.\n\nI tried for months to get her back, to no avail. Then I tried to move on. I had a couple flings, then met my next serious gf later that year. V did contact me again around this time. She asked about my new gf, we chatted, it also seemed like she was dating someone new. It hurt, I still had feelings for her, and I always held a space for her in my heart to return to, if she wanted to. That never happened. I stayed with GF, many years go by of just building a life together, renting a home, raising pets. We decide to leave the state. We hate the heat, the storms, the crowds, the traffic. We move up north. We buy a house, we get engaged, pregnant, COVID hits, baby boy, married, raise our son, work from home. Time sped up, life took over, we became great parents, but never really had time to just be husband and wife.\n\n\\--The Present--\n\nFor years I never even got a chance to look back, time was just moving so fast. But then I did, I looked back. And I didn't like what I saw. I searched for her name, the first result was her mugshot. She looked so sad, and scared, but still so beautiful after all these years. It became so clear at that point that I never healed properly from our breakup, or maybe even at all. Like I built a dam in my chest to hold back all of the feelings I still had for her, and when I saw that mugshot it was like a 100ft crack formed and now the water is gushing through. I wrestled with it for days, but eventually decided to text her. She was quite surprised that I reached out, but we had a few good chats early on. She opened up with me about a traumatic experience in 2024. I opened up with her about how I was feeling in my marriage, and how much I still feel for her, even all these years later, all these miles apart. There may have even been some flirty messages from her, bringing up old memories of a spicy time. Maybe her conscience took over shortly after as she made it clear that she is not interested in crossing any lines with a married man. I agreed, and recognized that my wife needed to know how I was feeling. I talked about a lot of things with my wife, but left out everything about V. We agreed to work on things, and we are planning to move back. Back to where we met, to be closer to family who can help with our son. We would also be moving back closer to V, and if things don't work out with my wife, I had this fantasy where I could have a coffee with V again. A second first date. Get to know who she is now, both of us changed for the better by the years, and maybe find out that we both like what we see.\n\nIf that's the movie ending you want, we're still a long way off. V became harder and harder to reach over the last month or two, replies to my texts getting shorter, or no reply at all. I would still check in with supportive messages every week or two. In case whatever she was feeling wasn't about me, just about where she was at with her grief. Well, it turned out to be the latter. She replied finally this past Tuesday. She told me that she was done, with everything. She laid out a very specific plan to end her life. I shattered. I started to shake. I pleaded with her, I tried to call her phone, for the first time in 14 years. No answer. She was still responding minimally by text, but not backing down. There seemed to be time though, her plan was for when family is out of town, and they are still there. I could barely sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. The next morning I'm texting again, not begging yet, not urgent, just good morning, let me know you're safe when you can. No answer. 1 hour, 2, 3, the texts are getting more urgent now. I tell her I will be contacting her family if she doesn't answer. No answer. I contact her family. Her two sisters, but both live out of state and cannot physically reach her. The only close family near her is her 17 year old daughter. The one who was 3 when we dated. I reach out to her and explain everything. This was heartbreaking. More heartbreaking, was that none of her family seemed surprised this was happening, again. She has done this multiple times in the past with family members, but it was a first for me. V finally texted me back around this time. But nothing to indicate that she would back down. I apologized for involving her family, but her response was \"None of my family is here\" which I read both as \"I'm so alone.\" and \"There's no one here to stop what happens next\".\n\nWhen she sent a final \"peace out\" emoji and turned off her phone, I knew I had to act. I messaged her family that she had shut off her phone, and to call 911. I dialed the non emergency line local to her and requested a welfare check, explaining the texts she sent. I honestly thought she was already driving for the bridge. Thankfully, I got a call from an officer at her home. V was home and she is unharmed. She was taken to the hospital where she will be safe for at least 72 hours. I got goosebumps from the relief I felt. The messages from her family offered a brief glimpse into how deep this pit was that she was in. She never let me know any of that, how many bridges she burned, how alone she was. But as the hours dragged on the relief just turned back into grief. It hurts, because I always wanted to be the one she could count on, not the one she’d feel cornered by. I don't know if she's mad at me, but obviously I would rather her be alive to be mad in the first place. Hate is a fine step up from indifference anyways. But I also know this: I can’t save her. And I won’t try to fix her. That’s not love, that’s control. I just want to walk alongside her, whatever that means. I want her to feel less alone, even if it’s just knowing someone out there truly sees her and cares.\n\nAnd now I'm left holding all of it. With a wife I can’t fully open up to. With friends who don’t really get it. With a son who needs my steadiness when I'm feeling anything but steady. The 72 hours ends tomorrow evening. I don't know what to expect when she gets out. Maybe she'll be angry with me, maybe still just numb. Maybe I'll never even hear from her again. I don't even know what I expect from posting this, I just needed to let other people read it, I guess.", "cleaned_content": "throwaway for obvious reason boire anyone directly involved would probably

I'm almost 30 now, so it’s safe to assume he has another family by now. For years, I never really understood why he abandoned us until a relative spilled the truth and my mom finally came clean. And wow, the story is messy. 😭\n\nApparently, my mom was his mistress without even knowing it. My dad never told her he was already in a relationship. They were together for years, mostly living in a different country due to work, so I guess that’s how he managed to keep it a secret from her. To make it worse, my dad’s friends knew and never warned her. Absolute trash behavior.\n\nLong story short, my mom got pregnant with me, and they had a shotgun wedding and even got a marriage certificate. The twist? My dad also married his girlfriend. 😭 Yup, double marriage. You’d think it couldn’t get worse, but somehow, it does. My mom is very gullible and genuinely loved that man, which is probably why she let him back into her life despite everything. After all that, he still came back to my mom, got her pregnant again, and that’s how I ended up with a full sibling. Since then, my mom has never even mentioned his name to us. This man seriously cannot keep it in his pants. 🤦‍♀️\n\nFast-forward to now: I discovered through a Facebook deep dive that he has four kids with his current family and they now live in a different country. Four. Like, dude already had four kids with another woman, and he still came back to mess up my mom’s life? Unbelievable.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: a few years ago, my mom got really sick and needed surgery. We didn’t have enough money, so we decided to sell some land my mom paid for herself. Sounds simple, right? Nope. Turns out, my dad’s name is on the title because one of his shady friends registered it under both their names without my mom’s consent. And guess who attended my dad’s wedding with his other wife? That friend. 🙃\n\nSo now we’re stuck. We can’t sell the land without my dad’s cooperation, and he’s been ignoring my messages for two years. Two years. He only replied once to say, “I know I’ve made a lot of mistakes as a father,” and then left me on read. Sir, do you even have a conscience? 😭\n\nI’m at my breaking point. Part of me wants to reach out to his current wife and kids to make them aware of the situation, but I’m conflicted because I know it wouldn’t solve anything. His refusal to cooperate has made our lives so much harder, and we’re still struggling financially. We really need to sell that land.

It's my hobby, my stress relief. For the past few weeks, I'd noticed a few things going missing, a ripe tomato here, a couple of peppers there. I figured it was squirrels or rabbits, though it seemed oddly specific.\n\nYesterday, I was working from home and happened to look out my window at an odd time.

Mrs. Gable is a widow, lives alone, and I know she's on a fixed income. She's always been so kind. She probably doesn't have much.\n\nI haven't said anything to her. What would I say? \"Stop stealing my zucchini?\" It feels petty. But it also feels a bit like a small betrayal, even though I know that's dramatic for a few vegetables.

He always comes to school in clothes that are a bit too small or slightly dirty, and he's often hungry, he devours the free breakfast and lunch like he hasn't eaten in days. He rarely has his homework, and when I ask, he just shrugs or looks down.\n\nI've tried talking to him, gently asking about home, but he clams up. He's got this haunted look in his eyes sometimes that just breaks my heart. He never talks about his parents or what he does after school. Other kids will chatter about video games or family trips; Leo just draws by himself during free time, often pictures of solitary figures in dark landscapes.\n\nI’ve called home a few times to \"check in\", calls go straight to a full voicemail. I sent notes home, no response. During our brief parent-teacher conference (which his mom was 30 minutes late for and seemed distracted the whole time), she brushed off my concerns, saying Leo is \"just a quiet boy\" and \"they're doing fine.\"\n\nMy gut is screaming that something is wrong. It's not just poverty; it feels like emotional and possibly physical neglect. But I don't have bruises to point to, no explicit disclosures from him. School policy for reporting is strict; you need \"reasonable suspicion based on specific observations.\" I worry my observations are too subjective, too \"gut feeling.\" If I make a report without enough concrete evidence and it's unfounded, it could make things worse for him if his parents retaliate, or they might just move him, and then I'll lose any chance of helping.\n\nEvery day he comes into my classroom, I feel this immense weight of responsibility and helplessness. I'm trying to be a safe space for him, give him extra snacks, praise his work, but I go home every night worried sick about him.

My boyfriend went on my phone while I was showering and trying to figure out what I wanted to say to him about everything and he found and edited my post. He then started yelling at me while I was still in the shower about sharing it online and calling him creepy. At the same time he was guilt tripping me and telling me that it was romantic and he did it because he loved me, he literally read a few of the comments out loud to me. He barely let me out of the shower but I did manage to get my clothes on while he was screaming at me. What really freaked me out was that he started listing off things that he could’ve done to me, I won’t list them here because it was extremely gruesome and I don’t think it’s allowed, but he said that he didn’t do those things because he’s such a nice guy. The way he described the things he could’ve done though made me feel like he had genuinely considered doing it. Also, I thought he was only watching me for a few months, apparently it was upwards of a year and it was genuine actual stalking. He had followed me home and to my college campus, he pulled out a collection of my lost hair ties that he kept.\n\nI told him that he was scaring me and that we needed to take a break and come back to it later. At that he put a hole in the wall next to my head. I told him that I was leaving after that because fuck that shit and it was like a switch flipped and he started crying, he got on his knees and begged me to stay and apologized. I ended up accepting his apology because I didn’t feel safe leaving. Yesterday morning after he’d left for work I grabbed all my important documents and irreplaceable things before my clinicals started and kept them in my car. After my clinical I didn’t go back to the apartment.

{"title": "I felt in love with my coworker but he has a girlfriend", "content": "It has been almost a year since I (25F) joined this company, two months after I got hired, they also hired John (28M), at first we weren’t really close to each other, he was nice and polite, everything flowed in a very professional way, but after we had one meeting only the two of us (because all of our work is from home) I realised he was really fun and we got along very well, our conversations became longer, leaving work stuff out of them, getting to know more of each other, he told me that he had a girlfriend, her name is Kelly, and they had been together for almost 7 years already, at this point we were just friends, so the fact of him having a girlfriend didn’t actually matter to me, I think things changed when we first met in person, my boss made a reunion so we can meet the team, talk about some clients, etc. When the meeting ended, I had to get to my best friends house, but it was the first time for me taking a new route to get there, so I was a little anxious, I told John about this and he offered to accompany me until I feel safe in the way. I was really grateful with him because I usually get anxious when I’m alone in the street, the thing here is that he actually took a really long change of route just so he could be with me, it was really unnecessary for him to do all that, and at first I wasn’t thinking about other intentions or anything, but looking back I think that feelings were already there in that moment, not only by me but he too, the thing with John is how well we get along, we’re always laughing, we have the same humor, is this kind of relationship where you can tell what the other is thinking just by looking at them, we really have a strong connection, also he really is the first person I feel seen by, with one word he can totally tell if I’m in a bad mood, if I’m not feeling well, etc. like he really sees me, and in more than one occasion he has demonstrated how much he cares about me, he is really caring and protective with me, he supports me whenever I’m not ok, and cares about everything I say, that is basically how our relationship has evolved, is more than just someone I have a crush on or something, he really is someone I can assure I love, not only because of what he does for me, but also because he is such an amazing human being, he is so smart and good at his work, he has this hard family story and yet he is so sweet, he is the kind of guy who would love to make you laugh, and always cares the most about others before him, I really admire him and love him.\n\nGetting back to the story, after that first meeting, our whole dynamic changed and now we would FaceTime every night before going to sleep, fast forward to our Christmas company party, I was really drunk and also happy because we had just received our bonuses, we were alone, so I jumped over to hug him cheering because of the money, and in one wrong move our mouths end of collapsing with each other, I wouldn’t actually call that a kiss, but right in the moment I realised what was happening, I ran away from him and prayed for him to just forget about it and never mention it, the problem was that he didn’t forgot, and he ask me if I remembered our little accident, at that point I was really anxious because I knew of his girlfriend, and I didn’t want for him to develop feelings for me, even if I already had feelings for him, like is ok if I have feelings you know? I can deal with them and leaving them outside of our friendship, because it has happened to me before that I catch feelings for a friend, but is not mutual so I just get over it. And my hopes were that with John this was the same, but the problem was that John actually felt something too, he didn’t confess when we talked about our accident, that conversation actually only ended with the two of us 100% sure that it was just an accident, that it meant nothing and that we had zero feelings for each other\n\nThe moment I felt hurt and we had our first bad moment was after a hangout, he was really physical there, he was holding my hand all the time, and giving me kisses every 5 minutes, kissing my cheeks, kissing my hands, hugging me, etc. I was really confused because at that moment I asked him if he had feelings for me, but he denied it, he even told me that he obviously had wedding plans with his girlfriend, that he really didn’t felt anything for me, that broke me, because at this point, seeing how he was acting, and all of our everyday calls, I already felt reciprocated, so I told him that he shouldn’t be kissing me all the time and hugging me, if he wanted to just being friends, that’s just not how friends act, he apologised, but at the same time he just kept saying how much he loved me, not that he was in love with me, but he loved me, and that’s why he was so affectionate with me, this kind of talk repeated like 5 times, and after every talk he would open more with me about his feelings, we got to the point where he actually told me how much he was in love with me, that he adores everything about me, he told me that he had never ever had this kind of connection with someone, and that there was  nothing he didn’t likes about me, he just told me that there was no way he could brake up with his girlfriend, and I never asked why, neither I asked him to do it, I just felt so bad because, on one hand he is this person with me, he says he loves me, that he adores everything I am, basically that he is so in love with me, but on the other hand, he is not ending his relationship, neither is treating me just like a friend.\n\nSo I gave him an ultimatum, I asked him to decide, what did he wanted? If he wanted to be with me romantically or just to be friends, the night I told him this, he was just crying a lot, saying how much he felt sorry for what he was doing to me, that it wasn’t ok, that he didn’t wanted to hurt me just the way he already had done, that he felt so sorry and so bad. I told him that if he really felt that sorry then he wouldn’t be acting romantically with me.\n\nI know that relationships are a two players game, and I know that is not just on him to stop this behaviour, I know that I had looked for it too, that whenever things get romantic I don’t stop it either, so I also know I’m dumb and a bad person for letting that someone with a relationship acts in that way with me, I’m not trying to portray me as an innocent person, or just a victim of him, if I had to explain myself, I think I would say that I love him, and one part of me wanted that things were done the right way, that he would talk to Kelly about what he was feeling and maybe see how things works out, (an open relationship maybe?), but that wasn’t happening, and being honest, the moment I felt the worst, was when told me about how bad he was feeling because of this whole thing, and that Kelly would ask him what was happening, and he would only tell her that he felt really sad, and she was there trying to support him, OMG how dare you let your girlfriend comfort you when your sad for this other person you’re in love with.\n\nI know I’m also winning my bad karma for this, that I’m also part of this whole bullshit, and I’m not a good person, or at least I’m not acting like one in this situation, that’s why I wanted to take this out of my chest, because I feel dumb being suffering for someone who says that loves me and loves his girlfriend but is hurting both of us, after the ultimatum he answered me the same as always, he is not leaving or talking with his girlfriend, and we are just friends. And lately that’s the path that we had actually taken, we had been polite, we haven’t said each other that we love each other, and I’m just working on accepting things how they are, also working on not looking for little silly moments, not letting things get out of hand. One day at the time I guess, and I hope I can value myself more so I can stop crying and feeling bad for a situation like this.", "cleaned_content": "it has been almost year since f joined thi company two month after got hired they also hired john m at first we werent really close to each other he was nice and polite everything flowed in very professional way but after we had one meeting only the two of us because all of our work is from home realised he was really fun and we got along very well our conversation became longer leaving work stuff out of them getting to know more of each other he told that he had girlfriend her name i kelly and they had been together for almost   year already at thi point we were just friend so the fact of him having girlfriend didnt actually matter to think thing changed when we first mettre in person my boss mad reunion so we can meet the team talk about some client when the meeting ended had to get to my best friend hous but it was the first tim for taking new route to get ther so was little anxious told john about thi and he offered to accompany until feel safe in the way wa really grateful with him because usually get anxious when im alone in the street the thing here is that he actually took really long change of route just so he could be with it was really unnecessary for him to do all that and at first wasnt thinking about other intention anything but looking back think that feeling were already ther in that moment not only by but he too the thing with john is how well we get along were alway laughing we have the same humor is thi kind of relationship where you can tell what the other is thinking just by looking at them we really have strong connection also he really is the first person feel seen by with one word he can totally tell if im in bad mood if im not feeling well lik he really sees and in more than one occasion he ha demonstrated how much he care about he is really caring and protectiv with h support whenever im not ok and care about everything say that is basically how our relationship has evolved is more than just someon have crush something he really is someone can assurer lover not only becaus of what he doe for but also becaus he is such an amazing human being he is so smart and good at his work he ha thi hard family story and yet he is so sweet he i the kind of guy who would lover to make you laugh and alway care the most about other before him really admire him and lover him \n\n getting back to the story after that first meeting our whole dynamic changed and now we would facetim every night before going to sleep fast forward to our christmas company party wa really drunk and also happy becaus we had just received our bonuse we were alone so jumped over to hug him cheering because of the money and in one wrong move our mouths end of collapsing with each other wouldnt actually call that kiss boire right in the momer realised what was happening ran away from him and prayed for him to just forget about it and never mention it the problem was that he didnt forgot and he ask if remembered our little accident at that point wa really anxiou because knew of his girlfriend and didnt wer for him to develop feeling for even if already had feeling for him lik is ok if have feeling you know can deal with them and leaving them outsid of our friendship because it has happened to before that catch feeling for friend boire is not mutual so just get over it and my hope were that with john this was the same but the problem was that john actually felt something too he didnt confes when we talked about our accident that conversation actually only ended with the two of u   sur that it wer just an accident that it meer nothing and that we had zero feeling for each other \n\n the momer felt hurt and we had our first bad moment was after hangout he wa really physical ther he wa holding my hand all the time and giving kisse every   minute kissing my cheeks kissing my hand hugging wa really confused because at that moment asked him if he had feeling for but he denied it he even told that he obviously had wedding plan with his girlfriend that he really didnt felt anything for that broke because at thi poindre seeing how he was acting and all of our everyday calls already felt reciprocated so told him that he shouldnt be kissing all the time and hugging if he wanted to just being friend that just not how friend act he apologised but at the same tim he just kept saying how much he loved not that he was in lover with but he loved and that why he wa so affectionate with thi kind of talk repeated lik   time and after every talk he would open more with about hi feeling we got to the point wher he actually told how much he was in lover with that he adore everything about h told that he had never ever had thi kind of connexion with someone and that ther wa   nothing he didnt like about he just told that ther was no way he could brak up with his girlfriend and never asked why neither asked him to do it just felt so bad becaus one hand he is thi person with he say he love that he adore everything am basically that he is so in lover with but the other hand he is not ending his relationship neither is treating just lik friend \n\n so gave him an ultimatum asked him to decide what did he wanted if he wanted to b with romantically just to b friend the night told him thi h wer just crying lot saying how much he felt sorry for what he was doing to that it wasnt ok that he didnt wanted to hurt just the way he already had done that he felt so sorry and so bad told him that if he really felt that sorry then he wouldnt be acting romantically with \n\n know that relationships are two player game and know that is not just him to thi behaviour know that had looked for it too that whenever thing get romantic it either so also know im dumb and bad person for letting that someon with relationship act in that way with im not trying to portray an innocent person just victim of him if had to explain myself think would say that lover him and one part of wanted that thing were done the right way that he would talk to kelly about what he was feeling and maybe se how thing work out an open relationship mayb but that wasnt happening and being honest the momer felt the worst was when told about how bad he was feeling becaus of thi whol thing and that kelly would ask him what was happening and he would only tell her that he felt really sad and she was there trying to support him omg how dare you let your girlfriend comfort you when your sad for thi other person your in lover with \n\n know im also winning my bad karma for thi that im also part of thi whol bullshit and im not good person at least im not acting lik one in thi situation that why wanted to take this out of my chest becaus feel dumb being suffering for someone who say that love and love his girlfriend but is hurting both of us after the ultimatum he answered the same alway he is not leaving talking with his girlfriend and we are just friend and lately that the path that we had actually taken we had been polite we haver said each other that we lover each other and im just working accepting thing how they ar also working not looking for little silly moment not letting thing get out of hand one day at the time gues and hope can valoir myself more so can

{"title": "I Accept Her Final Choice", "content": "She was sad. She was so very and overwhelmingly sad. She had a sickness in her mind that took her joy from her. Yet, I was so lucky to know her love, and she knew mine. We had so many wonderful days together when she was able to be truly happy. I just wished it lasted for her. At night she would cry to sleep in my arms and wished she wouldn't wake up in the morning. I know there are many more nights when I was not there. I felt lucky when she would call me on those nights and feel a little closer. I cared for her, with all my affection and kindness but love is unfortunately not a cure for any illness. She fought, She tried so many pills, saw so many doctors and spent so many nights alone in a hospital. She endured for as long as she could. I am grateful to her for every day she pressed on to spend with the people who loved her.\n\nThere are many people who pass away where it is a mercy. Its easier to feel when the origin of their suffering is physical. Loss from mental illness is hard, no one else could see the suffering she endured and trusted me with. I feel evil trying to explain it, to rationalize it now that she is gone. I would have done anything to keep her but she is at peace now and I can't take that away from her. I cling desperately to the comfort of knowing she got an end to the agony. She was prepared and as she went to sleep it was painless for her. Deep down through sadness and fear she was loved.\n\nA tiny fraction of her pain has been passed to me to carry forever along with the joy she gave me. When she left, she left knowing that I would have done anything for her. So I will be okay, because there is no doubt in my mind she could have made it to her peaceful rest thinking otherwise.\n\nI love her then, now and forever. She was everything to me for 3 wonderful years. She took her own life Sunday night after fighting this battle for nearly a decade. As I reflect on my feelings, I only care for her.\n\nThese dark thoughts I share might only make sense to me. Maybe I am broken too. I don't think anything could change my thoughts on this.

{"title": "I stayed friends with a toxic girl for years and it deeply affected me and someone else; I still think about it often and it haunts me.", "content": "Back in high school, I (22 F) was close friends with a girl I’ll call Kiwi. We met during freshman year (2017–2018) and bonded quickly over music and shared interests. At the time, I thought she was someone I could trust. My parents were very strict and rarely let me go out; most of my friendships were limited to school and eventually online. That made my relationship with Kiwi feel even more important; she was one of the few people I consistently interacted with, especially when COVID lockdowns hit during junior year (2019–2020) and we started talking daily over Discord.\n\nDuring sophomore year (2018–2019), Kiwi introduced me to Maya, a girl a year younger than us. Maya was on the spectrum, incredibly kind and sweet, and very talented and creative. We all became a little trio for a while; however, it didn’t take long before Kiwi started speaking poorly about her. She would criticize Maya’s art, call her clingy, and even say she was trying to copy me. Looking back, I realize Kiwi was feeding into my insecurities and manipulating me. She wanted me to feel superior to Maya; foolishly, I started to believe her. Eventually, Maya confronted me about how left out she felt. Instead of apologizing or listening, I ignored her. Worse, I sent her a message during winter break of sophomore year telling her not to contact me again and accusing her of being a stalker. I look back on that moment with deep shame. I was cruel to someone who had done nothing wrong; I let someone else’s toxicity shape my actions.\n\nKiwi’s behavior wasn’t limited to how she treated Maya. Over time, I started seeing how self-centered and petty she could be. She constantly made promises she didn’t keep. Once, during junior year (2019–2020), she betrayed my trust by revealing to my strict parents that I had been in a relationship, even though she swore she wouldn’t say anything. That single moment changed how my family saw me, and it hurt more than I can describe.\n\nIn our school’s HOSA club during junior and senior years (2019–2021), I was an active participant; I studied hard, competed, and placed second in a medical math competition. Kiwi, however, did not compete but volunteered as a dummy for a skills test competition, yet somehow received more praise and attention. She also took AP classes and was involved in more clubs and after-school activities than I was. My GPA was 3.95, which qualified me for high honors (3.9 minimum), while Kiwi’s was 3.89, earning her honors. Despite this, she once told me I didn’t deserve my high honors because of her heavier course load and extracurricular involvement, while I participated in some clubs like HOSA, Students Against Tobacco, UNICEF, Mental Health Club, and Art Club.\n\nAt graduation in senior year (2020–2021), Kiwi was the only person loudly cheering and clapping for me. I didn’t want her to do that, I knew how condescending and petty she could be, and it felt more like a jab than genuine support. It was upsetting that no one else was cheering for me, but even more upsetting that she acted like she was the only one who cared.\n\nAbout three hours after graduation ended, Kiwi sent me a text telling me I should be happy for her because she was moving to New York to pursue acting. The timing and tone felt like a deliberate slight and made me feel sick inside. Years later, this past year (2025), I found myself thinking about Maya constantly. In January 2025, I reached out to her via Instagram DMs to apologize sincerely for how I treated her, but to this day, she still hasn’t opened the message. I completely understand if she doesn’t want to see it. I know she hates me or is wary of me, and I would be too if I were in her shoes.\n\nJust last week, I saw Maya in public with her mother at the movies. I don’t know if she saw me, but I desperately wanted to say hi. I held back, though, overwhelmed by shame and regret. I didn’t know how she would react, and I worried that approaching her; especially in front of her mother; might overstimulate or upset her. I feel like a coward for not reaching out, but I didn’t want to cause her distress.\n\nI am still debating on whether or not I should DM her again and apologize even more sincerely. I want to ask if she’d be willing to meet for coffee so we can talk. I don’t expect her to forgive me or even respond, but I need to try. I want to make amends and maybe, if possible, heal some of the damage I caused.\n\nThe hardest part of all of this is the regret. I should have walked away from Kiwi long before I did. And I should have never hurt Maya. I think about her more than she’ll ever know. I wish I could apologize in person. I wish I had been braver and kinder. Instead, I let someone toxic get in my head and ended up hurting the wrong person. To this day, I still carry an immense amount of guilt; even though the friendship is over, it still lives in me. I hope Maya is doing okay. And I hope I keep growing from this.", "cleaned_content": "back in high school   f was clore friend with girl ill call kiwi we mettre during freshman year   and bonded quickly over music and shared interest at the time thought she wa someone could trust my parent were very strict and rarely let go out most of my friendships were limited to school and eventually onlin that mad my relationship with kiwi feel even more important she was one of the few people consistently interacted with especially when covid lockdown hit during junior year   and we started talking daily over discord \n\n during sophomor year   kiwi introduced to mayer girl year younger than us mayer wa the spectrum incredibly kind and sweet and very talented and creativ we all became little trio for while however it didnt tak long before kiwi started speaking poorly about her she would criticize maya art call her clingy and even say she was trying to copy looking back realize kiwi was feeding into my insecuritie and manipulating she wanted to feel superior to mayer foolishly started to believ her eventually mayer confronted about how left out she felt instead of apologizing listening ignored her worse her message during winter break of sophomore year telling her not to contact again and accusing her of being stalker look back that moment with deep shame wa cruel to someon who had done nothing wrong let someone else toxicity shap my action \n\n kiwi behavior wasnt limited to how she treated mayer over tim started seeing how selfcentered and petty she could be she constantly mad promettre she didnt keep once during junior year   she betrayed my trust by revealing to my strict parent that had been in relationship even though she swore she wouldnt say anything that single moment changed how my family saw and it hurt more than can describe \n\n in our school hoser club during junior and senior year   wa an actif participer studied hard competed and placed second in medical math competition kiwi however did not compete but volunteered dummy for skill test competition yet somehow received more praise and attention she also took ap classe and wa involved in more club and afterschool activitie than was my gper was   which qualified for high honors   minimum whil kiwi wa   earning her honor despite thi she once told didnt deserve my high honors because of her heavier cours load and extracurricular involvement whil participated in some club lik hosa student against tobacco unicef mental health club and art club \n\n at graduation in senior year   kiwi was the only person loudly cheering and clapping for didnt want her to do that knew how condescending and petty she could be and it felt more lik jab than genuin support it was upsetting that no one else was cheering for but even more upsetting that she acted lik she was the only one who cared \n\n about three hours after graduation ended kiwi text telling should be happy for her because she was moving to new york to pursu acting the timing and tone felt lik deliberate slight and made feel sick insid year later thi past year   found myself thinking about mayer constantly in january   reached out to her instagram dm to apologize sincerely for how treated her but to thi day she still hasnt opened the message completely understand if she doesnt wer to see it know she hate i wary of and would be too if were in her shoe \n\n just last week saw mayer in public with her mother at the movie know if she saw but desperately wanted to say held back though overwhelmed by shame and regret didnt know how she would react and worried that approaching her especially in front of her mother might overstimulat upset her feel lik coward for not reaching out but didnt wer to cause her distres \n\n am still debating whether not should dm her again and apologize even more sincerely wer to ask if shed be willing to meet for coffee so we can talk expect her to forgive even respond but need to try wer to mak amend and maybe if heal some of the damage caused \n\n the hardest part of all of thi i the regret should hav walked away from kiwi long before did and should hav never hurt mayer think about her more than shell ever know wish could apologize in person wish had been braver and kinder instead let someone toxic get in my head and ended up hurting the wrong person to thi day still carry an immense amount of guilt even though the friendship is over it still live in hope mayer is doing okay and hope keep growing from this", "author": "After-Okra4606", "date": "2025-06-06T07:48:09", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4luvj/i_stayed_friends_with_a_toxic_girl_for_years_and/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

I used to have some pretty bad issues regarding alcohol so I usually rarely drink (relevent I promise). I just changed states recently to move closer to friends and family and my life kinda just fell apart after that decision. After finally getting my kids dad to take him for the night my best friends and I decided to get drunk because of everything going on. Not great I know.\n\n   For some context My two best friends are together and have been for an extremely long time. I have always been slightly closer to \"T\" than her partner \"A\". That being said \"A\" has known me first and was the first person to ever show me kindness when I was a foster teen. \n\n  The morning after we drank I don't remember anything from the night before. We laugh it off and crack jokes about how drunk I was ow I fell off a bed (three times apparently), and how I kept laying on the floor. I had drank a bottle and a half of hard liquor. I guess the stress had really gotten too me. \"A\" starts acting off. I think I must've annoyed them and try talking to them about it but they brush me off. \n\n   A few days go by and I start getting my memories back in flashes. In those memories however \"A\" was having *** with me and preforming ***ual acts to me. I panic thinking I'm making stuff up and \"A\" would never. To make a really long traumatic reveal short, yes apparently \"A\" would. \n\n    \"A\" didn't drink that night but did smoke, a lot. \"A\" has since told us (me and \"T\") that they don't remember anything. If that's the case then is this not SA? And instead just two people making a really stupid mistake? None of us know and we may never know. In the time I've known \"A\" I've never known them to be this way, but from my memories it's so hard to know what actually happened. I feel so lost. \n\n    They may or may not split up. I've now lost my two best friends. \"T\" swears she's still my best friend but I feel her pull away. \"A\" has blocked me on everything, probably for the best, but it still sucks. All of this sucks. I am in therapy and it's not working. I feel if it wasn't for my son there would be no reason to exist. I feel like I can't trust my own memories, like I know what happened but I don't want to believe it. I'd rather be a whore than a victim I guess.

{"title": "Everyone I know vapes and I hate it", "content": "Does anyone else hate vapes? I was kinda desensitized to it for a while because literally everyone I know my age vapes. Like I can’t think of a single person who doesn’t in my friend group. I hate it so much. I keep on throwing little comments trying to get someone to quit or at least give the idea some credit, but no one ever cares. There is only one dude I know who wants to quit but I can’t tell if he’s just too addicted or if he doesn’t care enough but he hasn’t gave quitting much effort. It’s always the same excuse, “well I don’t even own one, I just hit my friend’s Ricks when I’m around them.” Or “I could quit if I wanted to, but I don’t want to quit so I won’t.” Like NONE of them can admit they’re addicted and it’s frustrating. And then the next week they are already back to owning one. I really would like to hang out with people without having to smell it every second. I hate it when I’m driving in MY car and someone just hits their vape without even opening a window. I have asthma too, not severe, but it still bothers me after a while. Also, I don’t think they ever clean the mouth hole of those things before they pass around the whole friend group. Like is that not disgusting?? Are y’all trying to get sick?? And how do y’all’s friends get rid of their vapes when they’re done? My friends decide the best way to do it is to throw it out the window while driving. It’s such a trashy thing to do. I just want some friends who don’t vape. My little sister sees my older brother vape and now she does too. Like holy crap, wait a few more years before you start making these awful decisions.\n\nOn a separate note, pens are so stupid. Or at least how my friends use them is. They’ll hit them before any occasion. About to go to work? Hit the pen. Family dinner in 30 minutes? Hit the pen. About to watch a movie? Let’s hot box MY car so it smells like ass before we walk into the theatre. I’m fine with smoking every once in a while, but you don’t need to be high for every moment of your life. Also, if you need it to go to sleep then you are either addicted, need a doctor, or need to stop looking at your phone for 3 hours before you go to sleep. You do not need to be high that bad. My brother and his friends will do this thing sometimes where they’ll bet on who can go the longest without smoking or vaping and it always goes the same way. One or two weeks after they start they either just start doing secretively or they decide to end the bet so no one pays money, cause they both can’t go without it for a week, but neither wants to admit it. I talked to my brother about it one day saying he should quit hitting the pen so much and he said, “ok name a bet for how long I can quit it” I said a week for 10 dollars and he said “10 dollars is not enough for me to stop, man. I can just go mow a yard or something and get more in less time.” Which is already frustrating that he thinks like that, but also I KNOW he can’t go without it for longer than a week because then he’ll just do it behind my back. I’m not getting scammed dude I know how these things always go down with you. I think I’m done. If y’all got advice or need to tell me I’m dead wrong, please do, I’m just done with hanging out around vapes 24/7. \n\n(Sorry if this is hard to read, I got dysgraphia and I’m not that good at putting sentences together.)", "cleaned_content": "doe anyon else hate vape wa kinda desensitized to it for whil because literally everyone know my age vape lik cer think of single person who doesnt in my friend group hate it so much keep throwing little comment trying to get someone to quit at least giv the idea some credit but no one ever care ther is only one dud know who want to quit but cer tell if hes just too addicted if he doesnt care enough but he hasnt gave quitting much effort it alway the same excus well even own one just hit my friend rick when im around them could quit if wanted to but wer to quit so wont lik none of them can admit theyre addicted and it frustrating and then the next week they ar already back to owning one really would like to hang out with peopl without having to smell it every second hate it when im driving in my and someone just hit their vape without even opening window have asthmer too not severe but it still bother after whil also think they ever clean the mouth hole of those thing before they pas around the whole friend group like is that not disgusting ar yall trying to get sick and how do yalls friend get rid of their vape when theyre don my friend decide the best way to do it i to throw it out the window whil driving it such trashy thing to do just want some friend who vape my little sister see my older brother vape and now she doe too lik holy crap wer few more year before you start making these awful decision \n\n separate note pens ar so stupid at least how my friend us them is theyll hit them before any occasion about to go to work hit the pen family dinner in   minute hit the pen about to watch movie let hot box my so it smells lik as before we walk into the theatre im fine with smoking every once in whil but you need to b high for every moment of your life also if you need it to go to sleep then you are either addicted need doctor need to looking at your phone for   hour before you go to sleep you do not need to be high that bad my brother and his friend will do thi thing sometime where theyll bet who can go the longest without smoking vaping and it alway goe the same way one two weeks after they start they either just start doing secretively they decid to end the bet so no one pay money cause they both cer go without it for week but neither want to admit it talked to my brother about it one day saying he should quit hitting the pen so much and he said ok name bet for how long can quit it said week for   dollar and he said   dollar is not enough for to man can just go mow yard something and get more in les tim which is already frustrating that he thinks lik that but also know he cer go without it for longer than week because then hell just do it behind my back im not getting scammed dud know how these thing alway go down with you think im done if yall got advic need to tell im dead wrong please do im just done with hanging out around vape  \n\n sorry if thi i hard to read got dysgraphia and im not that good at putting sentence together", "author": "NewspaperBubbly2352", "date": "2025-06-06T05:55:14", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4k3k6/everyone_i_know_vapes_and_i_hate_it/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}
{"title": "Feeling lost in my relationship. am I the only one still trying? I need advice or help.. idk", "content": "Hi Reddit, I’m using a throwaway account because this is really personal, and I need honest, outside advice.\n\nI (21M) have been with my fiancée (20F) for almost 3 years. We’ve been through a lot together… honestly, way more downs than ups. but we’ve always tried to hold it together. Lately, though, I don’t know if we’re still holding it together, or just holding on.\n\nSome background: When I was 18, I got kicked out of my mom’s house. We had a toxic relationship, and we’re mostly no contact now. I bounced around crashed with someone, got kicked out again, then ended up back in my home state. After some couch hopping and sleeping wherever I could, I moved in with a family member who was staying with my now fiancees family. That’s how we met, sharing a living space.\n\nWe’re the same age, but I’m her first serious relationship. At first, things felt easy. Then the family member I was with got a place nearby, and I moved in with them. She moved in with her own relative, and we stayed close. We were happy, and I was working toward my high school diploma while she worked mostly full-time.\n\nThen I got kicked out again, out of nowhere. She didn’t want me back on the street, so we moved into her family’s home. I didn’t love the idea, but I was out of options. Her mom’s abusive boyfriend was living there. He was mentally abusive to everyone and had a violent, substance-filled past. It was a nightmare. He’s gone now, but sometimes still pops up.\n\nSince then, it’s been nonstop struggle. We’ve both lost jobs. We’ve had four cars break down or get taken because of money or mechanical issues. We live in a dangerous, low-income neighborhood with no real job market and almost no transportation. It feels like every time we get a step ahead, something knocks us back down.\n\nWe both carry a lot of trauma. I’ve faced addiction, homelessness, and abuse. She grew up around addiction and serious family dysfunction and abuse. We’ve both tried therapy. she’s inconsistent with it, but still does try and go and I go regularly. I’m currently in IOP three days a week 3 hours each day, plus two different therapists. We tried premarital counseling too, but she quit after two months over something the therapist said.\n\nThe issue now is this: For a long time, she was on the fence about having kids. We’d talk about it seriously and it always ended with “yes, someday.” Suddenly, recently, she said she doesn’t want kids at all, ever. That was a huge shift for me. She also used to want to travel, live out of a van or something. I wasn’t into the idea at first (I just wanted stability because I’ve never had it much in my life), but recently I came around. Now she says I “waited too long” and she doesn’t want that anymore either.\n\nWe’ve fought, sure sometimes petty, sometimes serious but we always worked through it. Lately, though, it feels like we’re emotionally on different planets. I’m not even sure we want the same life anymore. But I love her and her family and still want to marry her\n\nWe made a plan recently to finally get out: she was going to stay with a relative out of town and I’m going to a 30-day addiction recovery program, both starting Monday. It was finally a way out of this cycle. But she backed out, because she couldn’t bring her pet spider. Now she’s talking about getting rid of all her things and “starting fresh,” which is fine, but I’ve fought to have the little I own. I didn’t have furniture or belongings growing up, I lived mostly out of boxes. These things represent stability to me, and she doesn’t seem to understand that.\n\nSo here I am, about to go get help, and I’m scared I’ll come back and realize we were never on the same page to begin with. I still love her. I care about her so much. But it’s starting to feel like I’m working toward a life with someone who maybe doesn’t even want the same life anymore.\n\nI’m exhausted. I want to heal. I want clarity. I don’t know if we’re still in this together, or if I’m just afraid to let go of something familiar. And the judgment that may follow.\n\nAny advice, thoughts, or questions are welcome. I just want to understand if I’m missing something, or if this is the beginning of the end. Maybe I’m in the wrong. Idk but I’m open!\n\nThanks for reading.", "cleaned_content": "reddit im using throwaway account becaus thi i really personal and need honest outsid advic \n\n m have been with my fiancer f for almost   year weve been through lot together honestly way more down than up but weve alway tried to hold it together lately though know if were still holding it together just holding \n\n some background when was   got kicked out of my moms hous we had toxic relationship and were mostly no contact now bounced around crashed with someone got kicked out again then ended up back in my home stater after some couch hopping and sleeping wherever could moved in with family member who was staying with my now fiancee family that how we mettre sharing living space \n\n were the same ag boire im her first seriou relationship at first thing felt easy then the family member was with got place nearby and moved in with them she moved in with her own and we stayed close we were happy and wa working toward my high school diploma whil she worked mostly fulltim \n\n then got kicked out again out of nowhere she didnt want back the street so we moved into her family home didnt lover the idea but wa out of option her moms abusif boyfriend was living ther he was mentally abusif to everyone and had violent substancefilled past it was nightmare hes gone now but sometime still pop up \n\n since then it been nonstop struggle weve both lost job weve had four car break down get taken because of money mechanical issu we live in dangerous lowincome neighborhood with no real job market and almost no transportation it feels lik every tim we get step ahead something knocks us back down \n\n we both carry lot of traumer iv faced addiction homelessness and abuser she grew up around addiction and seriou family dysfunction and abus weve both tried therapy sher inconsister with it but still doe try and go and go regularly im currently in iop three day week   hour each day two therapists we tried premarital counseling too but she quit after two month over something the therapist said \n\n the issue now is thi for long time she wa the fence about having kid wed talk about it seriously and it alway ended with ye someday suddenly recently she said she doesnt wer kid at all ever that was huge shift for she also used to wer to travel live out of van something wasnt into the idea at first just wanted stability because iv never had it much in my life but recently came around now she says waited too long and she doesnt wer that anymore either \n\n weve fought sure sometime petty sometime serious but we alway worked through it lately though it feels like were emotionally planet im not even sur we wer the same life anymor but lover her and her family and still wer to marry her \n\n we made plan recently to finally get out she was going to stay with out of town and im going to day addiction recovery program both starting monday it wa finally way out of thi cycl boire she backed out because she couldnt bring her pet spider now she talking about getting rid of all her thing and starting fresh which is fine boire iv fought to have the little own didnt hav furniture belonging growing up lived mostly out of box these thing represent stability to and she doesnt seem to understand that \n\n so here am about to go get help and im scared ill come back and realize we were never the same page to begin with still lover her care about her so much but it starting to feel lik im working toward life with someon who maybe doesnt even wer the same life anymor \n\n im exhausted wer to heal want clarity know if were still in thi together if im just afraid to let go of something familiar and the judgment that may follow \n\n any advic thought question ar welcome just want to understand if im missing something if thi i the beginning of the end maybe im in the wrong idk but im open \n\n thanks for reading", "author": "kindaverylostt", "date": "2025-06-06T05:27:53", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4jmid/feeling_lost_in_my_relationship_am_i_the_only_one/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}
{"title": "I broke up with my boyfriend because he took a job as a Deportation Officer at ICE and I can't stop second-guessing myself", "content": "Just need to get this out because it’s been sitting heavy on me and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it without it turning into an argument.\n\nMy 26F boyfriend 27M recently accepted a job as a Deportation Officer with ICE. I broke up with him over it. It sucks. I didn’t want to do it, but I also couldn’t see a way around it that didn’t involve me ignoring a huge part of who I am and what I believe in.\n\nWhen he first told me he was applying there, I had a bad feeling. I tried to keep it to myself at first because I didn’t want to seem judgmental. I know the job market isn’t great and that getting any federal job is a big deal. It comes with great benefits, good pay, real stability, retirement, the whole package. I get why someone would jump at that. He was excited. It felt like a big step forward for him and I didn't want to ruin that moment.\n\nBut I couldn’t ignore how much it bothered me. The idea of working in a role where your job is literally removing people from the country, sometimes people who’ve lived here most of their lives, just goes against everything I care about. I’ve always had strong feelings about immigration and human rights and this job felt like the exact opposite of that.\n\nWe talked about it, more than once. He didn’t see it the same way I did. He kept saying it’s just a job or it’s not like I make the laws, I just enforce them. That might be true, but to me it still felt like a line I couldn’t cross. I couldn’t see myself being in a relationship with someone doing that kind of work, even if they’re a good person otherwise.\n\nSo I ended it. And now I’m stuck wondering if I made the right call. Some of my friends think I overreacted and let politics get in the way of a good relationship. Others totally get it and say it was the right thing to do. I just feel torn.\n\nI still care about him.

{"title": "my mother mistreated me my whole life and now wants my money", "content": "I (21F) am a diagnosed autistic since I was a kid. My mother never told my diagnosis until I was 20, when she said she started accepting more because she saw a lot of \"autistic moms\" online. I was devastated for a while because she treated me like I was a terrible child during my whole childhood. She would leave me and my sisters for hours alone at home to hookup with men, not for money but because she wanted a revenge after our father divorced her.\n\nMy middle sister basically raised me. Mother would yell and beat me, once breaking my arm with an umbrella because I spilled water on the floor after tripping. She still cusses and yells at me at times for staying up late (my ADHD medication often makes me unable to sleep, even though I take medicine for insomnia), for going out with friends, when I accomplish something she often throws a fit saying I probably cheated or got someone else to do it for me.\n\nAnyway, last year she changed a little bit. She found out I can get money from our government because of my diagnosis and take like 2 years off work to focus on stuff like therapy. She was suddently happy to help me with everything, in october I'll start receiving this money and will officially start my 2 years off. Apart from obviously wanting my money, she also said she only helped me get therapy to make me \"more lovable\".\n\nI asked what she meant for that and she said I cried all the time when I was a kid and always had a face of sadness, which made me impossible to be loved. She said I still refuse to hug her and to be touched by her. I asked her \"and you know why I refuse?\" and she answered she had no idea and was probably \"one of those touch repulsed autistics\". How does she has no idea? Does she really thinks beating your child until she bleeds is normal? Does she thinks it's normal that none of my sisters have any contact with her because they saw how she treated me?\n\nI mean, there's just NO WAY she thinks any of this stuff is normal and that it's my own fault I have a \"sad face\", COME ON. She's a diagnosed narcissist, refuses treatment, refuses therapy, refuses any form of help and I'm the one that has to be her punching bag for being a terrible human?

{"title": "I 27f am giving up on my 65f future mil", "content": "I, 27F, have been in love with my now fiancé, 27M, since the day I met him. It was the classic best friends to lovers trope. We both have had lives that mirrored each other: growing up religious, developing mental illnesses at the same age, going to a Christian college and then breaking from Christianity as a whole around the same time, had similar abuse experiences, developed the same poor coping skills as a teenager (we were both emo as teens so I'm sure you can imagine). We truly feel that we are soulmates. We were best friends for six years before we started dating and hashed out most of our interpersonal problems well before we even started dating.\n\nRight now, our biggest issue is his mother, 65F.\n\nShe doesn't like me. It isn't just that she doesn't like me, she acts like I corrupted her son. I've helped him speak up for himself, become more independent, emotionally healthy. I helped him manage his DID symptoms (he is now in therapy), learn boundaries, and generally boosted his self esteem. In the almost ten years I known him, he is the healthiest I've ever seen him.\n\nHis mother is hard-core Catholic. She initially offered to help pay for our wedding because she knows that I come from a generationally poor background and cannot work due to becoming suddenly disabled as a teenager. But that has changed because of...being poor? We have had close calls with eviction a few times, but always manage to pull it out in the end. We've sold gaming stuff, done crowd funding, and do anything we can to make ends meet. This never causes a problem in our relationship btw, he knew about my financial background well before we started dating and has never once judged me or held it against me. I've even told him that he can leave me if he wants someone that can offer him more than I can with a clean break, no hard feelings but he CHOSE to stay. His mom on the other hand has offered now for the second time for him to move back in with his parents. This would also mean that I move back in with mine so that he can save up money until we can afford to live together because she feels bad that he has to work so hard. We never asked them to help with money for rent aside from cosigning a loan because of the first close call with eviction and she has said that she will not offer us any help because \"it isn't like we're married.\" It is my firm opinion that she wants to split us up physically to drive a wedge between us. I'm a lot different from past people he has dated. I'm loud, opinionated, laugh too hard at my own jokes, and speak my mind. I am as authentic as possible, so really what you see is what you get and I wouldn't have it any other way. His mom is a covert narcissist who puts on a show to be perceived as a god fearing meek woman that keeps to herself and pretty much doesn't speak unless spoken to. I've tried to talk to her using her own language, Volume, tone, and mannerisms she talked to me with and she took an issue with it. It's funny that she cornered me to talk to me when my fiancé wasn't there but when I spoke my mind she would no longer get speak to me about the subject unless my fiancé was there lol.\n\nMy fiancé and I are both at a loss and I give up. I wouldn't be surprised if we end up going no contact in the future. It sort of sounds like she doesn't like him being independent because he doesn't need her as much.\n\nTL;DR Catholic mom hates her son's fiancé that she deems as less than someone her son should be with.  \nSome extra info (I'm happy to give more if anybody is interested or has questions):\n\n\\- My fiancé used to be Catholic, but parted ways with it after a lot of trauma.\n\n\\- His family is avoidant of everything negative. Every story must have a happy ending, Catholicism is seen as the ultimate truth, and everything is a performance. His parents house honestly looks like a movie set. There is no dust and nothing is out of place.\n\n\\- His mother believes that too much autonomy is a bad thing.\n\n\\- We grew up to opposite extremes. His family is upper middle class and has never had to worry about paying bills and his parents go on multiple vacations in a year, like every couple of months. I grew up lower middle class in a rough area where sometimes the power bill couldn't be paid and we lived on food stamps.\n\n\\- Our current financial situation isn't awful, but not great. I am on disability, Medicaid, and food stamps. My fiancé works five days a week as a caregiver and has insurance through his workplace. We have a small business that sells my handmade jewelry and crochet plushies as a means of alleviating some of the minor household expenses, like dog food and toiletries.\n\n\\- Truthfully, I thought I was getting along well with my mil until the engagement party where our families met. As we were all leaving, I saw his mom make that one face all moms make when they clearly disapprove of a decision or life choice. I don't really have anything in common with her, but I can't think of any one instance that would make her turn on me.", "cleaned_content": "f have been in lover with my now fiancer m since the day

It's been small signs and questions that have got me suspicious.\n\nMy parents have never had a perfect marriage despite what I might have thought as a kid. I was always thought I had the perfect family and slowly came to the realization about how dysfunctional we really are after I started college. It would be small things like realizing that my parents never ever showed any true affection for one another. Then bigger things like realizing that on family vacations my friends parents would sleep in the same bed, while my brother would sleep in the same bed as my dad and I would sleep in the same bed as my mom. I also would see how they would speak to one another. How my dad would never defend my mom and how he would speak down to her. I saw how my mom would always seem upset and always just thought that's how we are. As I got older my mom started telling me more about what was wrong in their relationship. I also started to see the problems more clearly. My mom's issues with my dad and his family. My dad's issue blatant disrespect to my mom and disregard for her feelings. There was never any physical abuse to my knowledge but there were so many arguments that ended with them sometimes not speaking to each other for days.\n\nRecently, my mom has been asking a lot of questions that would seem really important to know if you were divorcing someone. When I first put it together I was leaving the house for something and just started crying in the car. In spite of knowing that they're not good together I don't know what life looks like when they're not. I don't want to say anything to let my mom know that I know because I'm scared to figure out that it's true. I'm also scared to just wake up and find out, but I'm also kind of relieved to know that I may be able to wake up soon without worrying about whether they're both in a good mood or not. I just feel so many things and at the same time feel so unbelievably numb. There are so many fun things that I was looking forward to that I just don't care about anymore.\n\nI'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and don't know what I should do.

This has never ever been a thought I’ve ever had about him- if you asked me a year ago I would’ve said gross. My friend is close with me and also close with my ex boyfriend.

I didn’t have any responsibilities when I was young. My husband misses the 21 year-old version of me. I’m still the same person honestly…I’m just grown up and I think that he just hasn’t grown up yet. \n\nI felt so embarrassed when I was venting to my friends and my male married friend said “damn what you do, men rarely ever initiate the divorce”….that comment just made me feel like I did something wrong. Maybe if I was more carefree, fun, and slept with him more he wouldn’t have left. I wonder sometimes \n\nMy husband fell in love with a 24 y/o girl. They go out together. They have fun together. They go on dates. She’s basically his girlfriend. \n\nI asked him if he loved her and he couldn’t look me in the eyes. He didn’t say anything. He loves her. Wow. He’s also been seeing her for almost a year. It started off causal and then they started going on dates and calling each other theirs. Like he will tell her “you’re mine”\n\nIt hurt me the most when my husband told me that his girlfriend reminds me of me when I was young, like when we first met back in college. \n\nShe told me that she’s beautiful, she’s full of life, she’s spontaneous, she knows how to live.\n\nI’m not beautiful? He said I am. But I’ve obviously changed. Well yeah.. I don’t expect to look the same after a decade. The other woman is obviously going to be more youthful and thinner than me. He said it’s also more than the physical \n\nHe loves that his girlfriend comes up with fun date idea. She randomly hits him up in the day and night. For example, I saw she texted him if he wanted to go axe throwing one night and other times she asks if he wants to go to a bar or club at 11pm… while I go to sleep at 9pm\n\nMy husband thinks I’m boring because I’m a wife and mom. He wanted to make me a wife and mom. It doesn’t make any sense that he’s not attracted to me. He said that sure he wants a good wife at home but he wants me to be different towards him. Honestly I don’t really understand. I kind of get it? He’s telling me he wants me to be fun again and carefree but that’s not possible with our current life. I get it men want to be excited and thrilled but we’re in our 30s, we have a child, we have jobs, bills, we have grown up problems and he’s acting like we can go back to having teenage problems. He isn’t turned on when I talk about our finances and our child all the time. Like what? We have life together and we have a child, get over it? We just keep going in circles with this conversation. I don’t entirely understand why he’s leaving me. \n\nHe’s gonna leave me with the lease. He’s not even on the lease. I’m the authorized person on the lease. He’s gonna move in with his GF. \n\nMy husband’s decision is final, he told me he’s filing for divorce and he still wants to be there for his son. He admits he doesn’t want equal custody. He expects to be a weekend dad or twice a weekend type of dad. I guess so he can have fun most of the time. I’m gonna give him what he wants. Not for him, but for me. I need a f*cking break. I can’t handle all of this responsible on my own. I know my son is so attached to his father too. My self esteem is completely gone. My husband ruined my life. \n", "cleaned_content": "hey thi is my first tim ever posting about my marriage so wanted to us burner account for thi personal post \n\n my husband and have   year old together and were both   yo \n\n my husband told he want divorcer thing werent perfect in our marriage could tell we were detaching from each other he just seemed so checked out from our marriage but didnt know he wanted divorcer \n\n it crushed my heart when he told that im not that fun life loving wild carefree girl that he mettre back in college im not cool anymore im not spontaneou anymore pretty much remind him of his mom and grandmer now he said never wer to go out and hav fun anymore and how im only focused boring thing lik getting hous job finance and our children \n\n that not completely tru we did date night boire classy dinner date what do you mean by thi is that were not clubbing and out at   am lik clubbing and lik going out that late anymore get it we used to do that when were in our early s but that was just completely tim of my life back then wasnt someone wife and mom back then and didnt even have job back then didnt hav any responsibilitie when was young my husband misse the   yearold version of im still the same person honestlyim just grown up and think that he just hasnt grown up yet \n\n felt so embarrassed when was venting to my friend and my mal married friend said damn what you do men rarely ever initiat the divorcethat just made feel lik did something wrong mayb if was more carefree fun and slept with him more he wouldnt have left wonder sometime \n\n my husband fell in lover with   yo girl they go out together they hav fun together they go dater sher basically his girlfriend \n\n asked him if he loved her and he couldnt look in the eyer h didnt say anything he love her wow he also been seeing her for almost year it started off causal and then they started going date and calling each other theirs lik he will tell her youre min \n\n it hurt the most when my husband told that hi girlfriend remind of when was young lik when we first mettre back in college \n\n she told that sher beautiful she full of life she spontaneou she know how to live \n\n im not beautiful he said am boire iv obviously changed well yeah expect to look the same after decade the other woman is obviously going to b more youthful and thinner than h said it also more than the physical \n\n he love that hi girlfriend comer up with fun date idea she randomly hit him up in the day and night for example saw she texted him if he wanted to go axe throwing one night and other time she asks if he want to go to bar club at pm while go to sleep at pm \n\n my husband thinks im boring becaus im wife and mom he wanted to make wife and mom it doesnt mak any sense that hes not attracted to h said that sur he want good wife at home boire he want to b toward him honestly really understand kind of get it hes telling he want to b fun again and carefree boire thats not with our current life get it men want to b excited and thrilled boire were in our s we have child we have job bill we have grown up problem and hes acting lik we can go back to having teenag problem he isnt turned when talk about our finance and our child all the time lik what we hav life together and we have child get over it we just keep going in circles with thi conversation entirely understand why hes leaving \n\n he gonna leave with the lease hes not even the lease im the authorized person the lease hes gonna move in with his gf \n\n my husband decision is final he told hes filing for divorce and he still want to b there for his he admit he doesnt want equal custody he expect to b weekend dad twice weekend type of dad gues so he can hav fun most of the time im gonna giv him what he want not for him but for need fcking break cer handle all of thi responsibl my own know my is so attached to his father too my self esteem is completely gone my husband ruined my life \n", "author": "lashesbyLiz", "date": "2025-06-06T01:11:22", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4eqou/my_husband_fell_out_of_love_with_me_and_in_love/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "positif", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

{"title": "i (18F) am my family’s emotional crutch and i can’t take it any longer.", "content": "i live with my mother (55F), my father (58M) and my older sister (20F) and we have always been a complex, but was i thought was relatively normal, family. my mother is a neurotic hypochondriac who’s a chronic micromanager and although she is caring and selfless, she is very emotionally unstable and volatile. she doesn’t mean to be, she has her own trauma from childhood and of course i love her very much, but i identify more in myself with my father. he’s very kind and funny but also very emotionally repressed - i’ve seen him cry once in my lifetime and it wasn’t even very much and my mother is very much the ‘boss’ of him. my sister is also pretty neurotic, she takes after my mother a lot and has always been the troublesome child. not so much in behaviour, she just requires a lot of space and always seems to have a conflict going on that occupies my parents’ time. she suffers with hypo-mobility and has always had health problems with her joints as well as vestibular migraines and also has severe anxiety and used to be very prone to panic attacks. i love her and we mostly get along, but she’s very self-involved and uses me more so as a crutch to offload her problems on to and go to when she has no one else. i always feel like i’ve been striving for her approval in a way, she’s the cool older sister and she doesn’t mean to be, but like my mother, she can be quite critical of me. in this way, i have always felt quite alone in my family. everyone has their own set of problems but as the youngest and the child who has always been ‘capable’ and not a mess like my sister, i have inadvertently sort of slipped through the cracks and just ‘existed’ while never taking centre stage. but anyway, my family is very much an eggshell family.\n\nwe’ve had a crisis recently - my sister dropped out of university and moved back home, both my parents developed cancer early on in the year and are undergoing treatment as we speak. my father barely talks about it, treats it as it if isn’t happening, but my mother never stops talking about it. i understand she is scared and as a hypochondriac this is her worst fear come true and i am trying to be there for her the best i possibly can, but i’m also doing my a levels at the moment and having relationship issues and i’m finding it all to be quite a lot. i’ve suffered in silence for a while, being indifferent with my dad, hearing my sister’s endless problems of what her uni friends are doing without her, what her talking stage is doing, what she’s going to do with her life next and of course my mother is holding me to an impossibly high standard, getting offended over the smallest things (like me trying to show her shoes i thought i was going to buy for my prom in a couple of weeks while she ‘has cancer’) and being irritated i don’t make her food or lunch while i have a life-altering exam this monday and i’m trying to study around everything. and the worst part is, she never listens to me. i can’t tell her how i feel, even though she’s my mother, because i’m the ‘capable one’ and if i ever told her how much stress this was putting on me all the time all i’d hear was ‘well imagine how i feel’ and be called ungrateful, dramatic and selfish. i know it’s only a few weeks, but after my exams are over it feels like there will be new problems in my family that take up all my time. i know it sounds selfish and ungrateful and i’m legally an adult but i’m still my mother and father’s daughter and my sister’s younger sister and i’m sick of being treated like the emotional crutch. i feel really alone and i don’t usually post things like this but i can’t stand being in my house anymore and i’m

{"title": "Tried to return a lost wallet, guy then thought I stole from", "content": "This happened recently and honestly, it left me feeling weird. I was heading home from work (about 50 minutes out of the city I work in), and I found a wallet in a gas station parking lot. It had cash, cards, ID -- but no phone number or easy way to contact the owner. There were credit cards and money in the wallet. I thought that with folding money and credit cards, I wouldn't want my wallet passed to a store clerk at a gas station. I wanted to do my good deed (pride before the fall).\n\nI looked through it for contact info. Wallet Guy's ID was there. I tried to find a phone number on the internet, nothing for Wallet Guy. As I searched through the wallet, I found a woman’s name on the insurance card as the primary. I looked that up, she lived at the same listed address same as Wallet Guy's. Looking at her listed age, I assumed it was his mother.  I called and announced myself on the voicemail--Wallet Guy picks up, and we agreed to meet the next day after work so I could return it.\n\nToday at the end of my work day, I met with Wallet Guy to return his wallet. While on my commute home, he called me. He sounded a bit tense and angry, he claimed he was missing his cash and numerous credit cards. I told him exactly what was in there when I found it. I pulled over to rifle through my bag, thinking perhaps I had caused something to slip out of the wallet. A couple of minutes later Wallet Guy calls back and it turns out that the cards and money were still there---just not the same spots as he remembered. I had not placed the items back in the wallet as he had them (that mistake was on me, but I didn't have a sneaky subroutine running in the background).\n\nHe kind of apologized and offered to buy me a six-pack, which was nice I guess, but I declined. I told him I was just glad he got everything back.\n\nStill, I’d be lying if I said the whole thing didn’t leave a bad taste. I did the right thing, and still got that initial “you stole from me” vibe. That sucked.\n\nFunny part is, I actually know the gas station clerk pretty well. Stopped by the next day, and he told me the cameras saw me pick up the wallet. He never said anything to the guy, which I appreciated. But it made me wish I’d just handed it in right there and walked away.\n\n# Lesson learned:\n\nIf I ever find a wallet again, I'm turning it into the business right away or the cops.\n\nI still think trying to help is the right move--I just should've thought things through on this scenario.", "cleaned_content": "thi happened recently and honestly it left feeling weird wa heading home from work about   minute out of the city work in and found wallet in gas station parking lot it had cash card id   but no phone number easy way to contact the owner ther were credit card and money in the wallet thought that with folding money and credit card wouldnt want my wallet passed to store clerk at gas station wanted to do my good deed pride before the fall \n\n looked through it for contact info wallet guy id wa ther tried to find phone number the internet nothing for wallet guy searched through the wallet found womans name the insurance card the primary looked that up she lived at the same listed address same wallet guy looking at her listed age assumed it wer his mother   called and announced myself the voicemailwallet guy pick up and we agreed to meet the next day after work so could return it \n\n today at the end of my work day mettre with wallet guy to return his wallet whil my commuter home he called he sounded bit tense and angry he claimed he was missing his cash and numerous credit card told him exactly what wa in ther when found it pulled over to rifle through my bag thinking perhaps had caused something to slip out of the wallet couple of minute later wallet guy calls back and it turn out that the cards and money were still therejust not the same spot he remembered had not placed the item back in the wallet he had them that mistak was but didnt hav sneaky subroutine running in the background \n\n he kind of apologized and offered to buy sixpack which was nice gues but declined told him wa just glad he got everything back \n\n still id b lying if said the whole thing didnt leav bad tast did the right thing and still got that initial you stole from vibe that sucked \n\n funny part is actually know the gas station clerk pretty well stopped by the next day and he told the camer saw pick up the wallet he never said anything to the guy which appreciated but it made wish id just handed it in right ther and walked away \n\n  lesson learned \n\n if ever find wallet again im turning it into the business right away the cops \n\n still think trying to help is the right movei just shouldv thought thing through this scenario", "author": "DarthQuark_KY", "date": "2025-06-05T23:45:25", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4cyfq/tried_to_return_a_lost_wallet_guy_then_thought_i/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

{"title": "My mother became my Lone Shark", "content": "So I F(20) still live in my mother's F(39) house. We live in a big city and it's very expensive for any of us to live separately. My mom bought me my dog a few years ago a long with all the stuff I would need for a dog. I was fine with paying her back, which I started doing once I got a new job (I was unemployed at the time). I gave her 300 dollars in total back, while she said I owed her around 1k. And After that it was okay for a while. \n\nBut every now and then she'd have an episode and yell at me and my sister F(17) about how she needs money and how money is tight. And how we owe her money. She'd ask me when I'm going to pay her back the money and I just say \"I will\" and that would usually be the end of it.\n\nToday I went to an interview and afterwards took a nap, I woke up to her lecturing my sister and suddenly she yelled at me about how I need to give her the money I owe. I told her I gave her 300 and she never told me how much left I have to give her. Because she's always saying how the dog alone was 1k. And she dropped the bomb on me that actually the 300 doesn't matter because of all the stuff she's bought since then and gas money. Meaning she's added interest to my debt that I wasn't made aware of until 2 years later. She said I owe her for: \n\n-The food she buys and throws away (I don't eat or go shopping with her)\n-The gas for transportation (I offer to pay while I'm riding with her, which rarely happens, and she declines and never goes to the gas station)\n-And interest in general for what she's done for my dog (Which is just opening the door to let her out without telling me and leaving her outside for hours)\n\nAnd it made me cry cause my whole life she has kept me on this money anxious leash cause she's always talking about money. It's all that ever matters to her. I can understand wanting your money back and all, but she's trying to keep me in debt for things that aren't even mine. I pay half the bills and a third of the rent. I work full time like her and even if I get sick due to my already weak immune system she just scolds me for not making money. I can't even go to a higher paying job without her stressing me out about money. \n\nShe only ever talked to me about her money struggles when I was a child, forcing me to mature at an early age to understand the weight of prices and how my family is poor but can't afford anything. Causing me to starve myself unless I'm being served at dinner as a little kid. Picking out the cheapest toys, clothes, and shoes if I'm given the chance. While all that money I was saving was going towards what my sister wants. She never had to worry about how money affected our lives, she wasn't made to take the weight of our mother's financial dread. But I was. One of my earliest memories is me sitting on the toilet of a store's bathroom while my mother frantically counted loads of money while telling me, A TODDLER, to keep it a secret. Everything was a secret. Can't tell anyone anything ever. Taxes are pain, life is pain, everything is expensive. \n\nFilling your child with financial dread and complaining when she doesn't go out to the club or with friends. Complaining when she doesn't eat. And still complaining when you get the money you asked for. I give my mother 500 a month for rent and the gas and electricity bill. I'm fine with that. But she always asks for more. She got a car she couldn't afford long term and blames me for not wanting to split payment with her on it. Or better yet, getting a ride on the bus. God forbid. \n\nShe's made me so anxious about the cost of her fucking help that when I'm in danger she's the last one I call. When I was raped I didn't tell her. I just wanted until my rapist took me home. Because God forbid my mother help her daughter in a time of need. And it's not like this is just my PTSD talking. I crashed on the street one time and fucked up my legs pretty bad on the way to work on my electric scooter and I had to call her. She showed up already angry she had to take a 5 minute drive down the street. Then lectured me about working through everything no matter what while driving me home. I can't even get into a crash on the road without her lecturing me about money. That's fucking insane.\n\nBut apparently everyday I just exist in this house, despite what I do to deserve to live here, I am having interest from my own mother who has me in debt.

{"title": "I've felt undeserving of life ever since I was a young teen.", "content": "I've felt this way ever since I was in middle school. I'm almost 30 now. I think a lot of it comes from knowing that most people view us as subhuman and every other typical thing labeled on us. \"Degenerate, perverted, satanic, evil, groomers\", and many more.  \n\nThere was a small period of a few years where I remember feeling a little bit hopeful like things were getting better.  \"Glee\" was one of the most popular shows in culture, lady gagas \"born this way\" was popping off, marriage equality happened. That didn't last long though. I think around 2016, things slowly started taking a downturn. It's at the point now, where anytime I open up fb or X, there's there's another of the most vile,  anti gay posts, where pretty much everyone is in agreement. And more and more, infleuncial people continue to take anti gay positions that would have been radical in 2012.\n\nThe anti gay people are celebrating over pride being dead and how we are \"healing\" now. \n\nI've just felt like I don't deserve to be here ever since I was a teen. So I never really tried too hard at anything. Never allowed myself to pursue goals or dreams because I always felt I was just \"dirty\" and \"wrong\" and that it didn't matter. I took classes here and there to try to make an effort, and I'd pass, but I'd always end up dropping out.  \n\nI've always worked full-time but only dead end entry-level jobs and because of that, I still live with a parent. \n\nI've used food for as long as I can remember to help with how I felt and it's always been one of my only reasons for living. It's pretty the only enjoyment I get besides from my weekend binge drinking. \n\nAnd because of that, I'm 320lbs. That adds it's own problems. I can't hookup or meet other guys with this body,  and I understand it as I would want to either, but it doesn't make it any easier. \n\nAll of this is because I'm gay. And it's fucking frustrating because I never had a choice in this. I remember having my earliest gay feelings at age 6. I remember one moment pretty vividly.  I was sitting in the floor, in front of the TV and a commercial for the first Harry Potter movie came on and I had this funny feeling over Harry. At the time, I didn't know what gay was as concept. I had never seen or heard of such a thing. I remember feeling confused about it and like I was a freak or something because of that. \n\nThe older I got, the more and more I had the feelings. In 5th grade,  I hit puberty and then it wasn't just little crushes anymore, it was physical attraction. By that time I knew what gay was but I kept telling myself it was just a thing that would go away and that if I prayed, it would. But I really carried a heavy weight on my shoulders. It was then when I first started feeling like I do now..feeling guilty and feeling like I don't belong here. Those feelings really came to fruition in 8th grade when I realized I was gay and that it wasn't to go away and that those god damned prayers were useless. \n\nAnd that's what led me to where I'm at now. \n\n I'm starting to have some health issues that are going to end up being serious because of my diet and weight, but I think I'm digging my own grave here. I don't think I can be happy or ever feel normal as a gay man.

She started buying plastic plates so she would have to clean up ceramic less. \n\nThe first time he hit her, apparently, was when he was drunk one night and they were arguing about him accusing her of cheating on him. She brought forward evidence that he was wrong and he hit her, while falling her shoulder into a door jab so hard it bruised. She left for less than a week. Next was the apologies. She moved back in since he promised to be better. \n\nI get a call, Valentine’s Day at 2am of her bawling her eyes out because they got into another argument and because she shoved him first he put her into a head lock. Twice. Somehow also damaged her arm so that she lost feelings in her fingers on one of her hands. She moves out for a month before going back to him. \n\nThe night of their 4 year anniversary he gets black out drunk. Accused her of cheating on him. Throws her down a flight of concrete stairs. She bails. Next morning she goes back to get a change of clothes and he’s folding laundry. Oblivious that he could have killed her the night before. She moves out with the week and swears to me up and down that she won’t see him again. \n\nCut to 6 months later she told me she has reconciled with him because “he’s changed”. And how she’s “tested” him and his reactions are better and different. FUCKING WHAT. \n\nI left her on read for a day. I create a long message today telling her that since she’s decided to go back to him that I’m getting off this sinking ship. I wrote the message. Blocked her on all of social media. Including all of her side profiles. Sent the long letter. Blocked her number. And breathed a deep sigh of RELIEF. \n\nI’ve supported her for as long as I could. I’ve answered the middle of the night phone calls of her crying over something he done. I’ve sent money so she could pay rent because he lost his job.

I’ve had my wins and successes, but the last few years have been just exhausting and I really don’t know how much more I can take.\n\nI grew up with parents who were addicts. I am not, but the neglect impacted me as an adult, especially in relationships. I’ve done a lot of therapy.\n\nMy grandma was murdered by a nurse several years ago (nurse stole morphine and messed with my grandma’s chart). I spent the majority of my 20’s fighting the Ontario court system to seek justice. The nurse only received 2 years last January, she’s already out on parole. I sued the nurse and the hospital on behalf of my family which was emotionally and financially exhausting and the payout wasn’t worth it (nurse still owes me for her crimes).\n\nI struggled with hoarding while dealing with this. My apartment became horrible. To escape my apartment, I was dating recklessly just to stay at other places and I was in emotionally abusive relationships (I was a sugar baby for a few years). I ended up getting genital HSV-1. The herpes is what it is (I don’t want to add to the stigma), but it was a reality check that I wasn’t respecting myself.\n\nI decided to take control and hired cleaners to help me clean my apartment, only to come home and realize they threw away / stole the majority of my belongings. I had no underwear (or any clothes for that matter). Keepsakes were gone. Furniture was gone. Designer items gone. I agree some items probably needed to be thrown away, but based on the evidence it was clearly them trying to take advantage of my mental health struggles. I had drained my account and spent almost $3000 to pay for this.\n\nI will be suing them, but I’m financially in horrible spot. I struggled with a shopping addiction to cope with my depression. I owe $45,000 on a credit card I’ve had since I was 18. I owe approx $10,000 left with my OSAP. I was getting set up to have debt consolidation done, but was recently fired in February because I appeared distracted. I was distracted, I had been robbed, but I was trying to work through this. I am on EI, but it’s hard to get by with my debt. I’m trying to find a job but the market is horrible.\n\nI was swept up in a relationship with a woman who had BPD and it took a huge emotional toll on me. It distracted me from my priorities. I am still healing from that and I miss her. I miss having someone. Anyone. But it wasn’t healthy. She told me she self harmed the night she broke up with me and I feel sick about it. I had to go no contact.\n\nI can tell I’m depressed because my apartment is getting messy. I have no desire to get out of bed, I don’t know what my purpose is and I’m so exhausted. I spent years dedicating my life to fight for justice for my grandma, but that’s over, and the outcome was less than desirable. When I was a sugar baby my life revolved around that to escape my depression, but I can’t go back to that, it wasn’t healthy and truthfully I feel so ugly right now.\n\nI feel like I’m such a burden because it feels like I always have something going wrong and I feel bad talking on friends and family about it.\n\nI’m really struggling. I feel so alone and overwhelmed and I don’t know how to fix this. I’m alone, I don’t have a job, I have so much debt, so many of my things are gone, I can’t afford my medication because I don’t have insurance.

{"title": "My sister married a sect member that is ruining our lives", "content": "(all the mentioned names are fake for privacy)\n\nTW: violence, child abuse\n\nhi. i have to give a lot of context to be able to tell this story properly.\n\nmy sister, Vanessa (33F), is about 13 years older than me and has had two previous marriages. she had her first kid, Gary (12M) with her first husband (who is not in the picture and never has been) and her second child, Frank (6M) with her second husband, Isaac (38M).\n\nVanessa has always been a problem child for my parents (both in their mid-50s). she has a certain personality that really clashed with our mom's (who tends to be on the emotional side), and throughout my entire childhood i kept seeing them endlessly arguing. but she wasn't unreasonable, she would always come around and apologize eventually. she was mostly fine until she met her current husband.\n\na few years ago, my sister came back home (a non-EU country) from where she lived with Isaac (EU country) an brought both of her kids with her. we heard all sorts of stories from her - how he was degrading, emotionally manipulating and abusing her and her oldest kid Gary, so she essentially had no choice but to leave the country. i was always kind of estranged from my sister due to our age difference, so i tried to console her throughout that period to improve our relationship. some things really threw me off about her story though, especially that during the last 6 months of her dying relationship with Isaac, she was cheating on him with one of Gary's teachers. my sister and Isaac ended up eventually divorcing and splitting the custody of Frank (I don't know anything about custody laws) in a way that Vanessa had him for most of the year, while Isaac got to see him for 1-2 months per year in the EU country he lives in. there were some problems before this of course - Isaac filed a kidnapping report on Vanessa - but eventually it was resolved without court thanks to our father acting as a mediator between them.\n\nafter a while of her living with us back home, my sister got in contact with a man named Ted(40M), who was going through a divorce just like her - it didn't take long before they started dating. my parents have known Ted for well over 10 years now. he had two kids (11F and 7M) with his ex-wife, who will be relevant later on. i never really liked Ted. when i was about 8 years old, i used to hang out with a friend of the same gender as me and he just happened to see us hanging out. he told my parents that i should be sent to gay conversion camp because we would hug frequently - saying that it's a sin that needs to be repented. needless to say I never had a trusting bone towards him in my body, so when i found out that my sister is in a relationship with him, i tried to express my concern to my parents. they didn't really listen to me, as they \"knew him\" and thought that he was a decent man who would be able to take care of Vanessa. when i brought up the gay conversion camp, they told me that he had a super-religious phase back then, but promised that he's no longer like that. haha...\n\nabout 4 months into them dating, my sister decided to suddenly move in with Ted in a different EU country (where he is from) and took her kids with her without my parents' or Isaac's knowledge. she then proceeded to cut contact with our entire extended family, sending mostly everyone personalized essays on how they were terrible people and all the ways that they had wronged and hurt her. i can personally confirm that most of the family members that \"wronged\" her were not at fault. I'm afraid it would take too long to explain my reasoning, but there will be enough evidence later on.\n\nTed acted as the communicator between my sister and my parents for a while - he told them that he found a therapist that would work through my sister's problems. in the end, after a couple months, my sister apologized and tried to fix her relationship with everyone. I was not directly involved in the situation, but my family members have showed me the messages she sent, where she would talk shit about me even though I never did anything to her, as I didn't even live in the same country as her for most of my life. Since then I have always kept my guard up around her, knowing that she thought differently of me than what she let on.\n\nEverything was more or less fine with her until the summer of last year, when we found out that she decided to accept Protestantism as her faith, which Ted introduced her to. Protestantism is a really uncommon religion for our home country, but we thought that it's probably a good thing, as religious faith can teach you some decent lessons to apply in life. But it got to the point that it was all she would talk about - she would always mention how she was reading the bible, listening to some passages, how it filled her heart with love and acceptance. Vanessa was aware that our mother and I are both atheists, yet she wouldn't stop recommending us to read the bible and look into her religion. it was slightly annoying, sure, but it wasn't a big deal until her kids started getting involved. the first red flag that arose in my head was when Gary (who was 11 at the time) asked me why people started dying faster, as according to the bible, some people lived for thousands of years. or when Gary told me that i would be in purgatory for not believing in god and how god was his savior. i want to clarify that i do not have a problem with any religion, but these instances with Vanessa and Gary made it seem like they were trying to indoctrinate us.\n\nwith time, this got worse. during New Years, my parents invited my sister, Ted, and all 4 of their kids to celebrate it. me and my partner were also invited. the few days leading up to the new year, things were really tense between Vanessa and our mother, they were constantly arguing about how my sister and Ted let their kids practice \"intuitive eating\", which basically meant that they would only eat when they wanted to and could stop eating when they wanted to stop. she did this because that's how she and Ted lost weight and she \"didn't want her kids to be overweight\". my mother had an issue with this because kids can't always tell when they are hungry and the entire thing could lead to malnutrition. eventually it got to the point where our father had to step in, telling Vanessa that she should listen to our mother while she is under their roof, and do whatever she wants in her own household.\n\nnew years is when it all got SO much worse. a few hours after the main celebration, my parents and all the kids went to bed, so it was just me, my partner, Ted and Vanessa. we were all pretty drunk and my sister was trying to make conversation. she mentioned how she's worried for me and my future, and i tried to tell her that it's going to be fine. out of nowhere, Ted interjected, confidently saying \"no, actually, 2025 will be the worst year of human history\". me and my partner were reasonably taken aback, but we decided to stay and listen why he was so sure of that. he went on the most deranged rant i have ever heard in my life about how, according to prophets like baba vanga and some other prophets i cannot for the life of me remember, the end of the world, or judgement day, is going to happen. i'm not going to get into the details of it because there was just so much information, but the main points were this:\n\n* apparently scientists have discovered the \"god gene\" that lets our prayers be sent to god\n* at some point some mysterious evil organization will create a covid-like \"plan-demic\" that will cause all of the borders to shut down\n* then said mysterious evil organization will insert chips into the foreheads of every person on the planet, which will modify the \"god gene\" and send your prayers to the antichrist instead of god\n* the antichrist will apparently be the world trade forum and the beast will be a \"new sentient AI\"\n* everything will be affecte by this except like 2 countries so you have to sell all your assets as soon as possible and move there before april, when this was all supposed to happen\n\nthere was so much more and this is just scraping the surface. at first i thought it was all a joke and that they were baiting us, but they were completely serious, and showed us maps from an unknown source of what will happen to the world within the first 3 months. needless to say, this was the moment i realized that Ted was utterly insane an this was something beyond religious beliefs. I later decided to talk to my parents about this, but they told me to let them believe in what they wanted to. the problem with that was that they truly believed all of that and were planning to sell everything they own in the EU and move to the aforementioned \"safe countries\" and take all 4 kids with them, without Isaac's knowledge or Ted's ex-wife's.\n\ni started avoiding both of them because i was honestly terrified of them. i had no idea how to even act around people that were so deep in their own delusions so my partner and I tried to keep contact with them to a minimum to avoid any more conversations like that. unfortunately that didn't work out so well. we still kept having meals together and around two days after new year i got into an argument with my sister for the first time in relation to their prophecies. later that night, at around 3AM, Vanessa barged in to the room my partner and I were staying in, visibly very drunk and high (forgot to mention that she and Ted are avid weed smokers). she said that she wanted to talk to me and I told her that i didn't want to, especially since she wasn't sober and it was really late. she kept insisting and decided to have a conversation with me regardless and ended up closing the door behind her. i really wasn't in the state of mind to deal with her in that state, so i tried to open the door behind her, which ended up with her putting me in a chokehold.\n\nfor reference, my sister is really fit in comparison to me, so she was easily overpowering me. she started choking me, gripping my wrists, pushing me down on the floor all while verbally berating me and saying that i am nothing but a snotty brat that got undeserved attention from our parents and how i should do as she says because she is my older sister. of course, my partner jumped in to stop the altercation (without violence) as soon as it started, but she started forcing them outside of the room and almost broke their arm by slamming it in between the door. not late after, Ted came running, hearing the entire altercation. he didn't try to stop her, all he did was just stand there and watch, until he got the chance to drag my partner out of the room, leaving me and my sister alone where she continued to physically overpower me. what my partner later told me was that he stared them in the eyes and said \"don't get involved, let them talk it out, they're family\". my partner refused and decided to try and force my sister out of the room, which somehow succeeded (i almost have no memory of it).\n\nmy parents had woken up from the commotion after my sister and Ted left and went to check on me and ask me what happened, and at that point i was barely able to speak from hyperventilation. they gave me something to calm me down and later my partner and i explained what happened. they said they would go talk to her and told us to block the door with a chair since there was no lock. apparently it was fruitless because it was impossible to reason with her in that state, so they left her alone outside and told Ted to not let her back in until she's calm enough. she kept screaming at me under our window, telling me that i will burn in hell for all eternity. she also started throwing things at the window which scared the shit out of me. the next few days until my sister and Ted left, my partner and I wouldn't leave the room in fear of encountering Vanessa and Ted and we kept our door barricaded the entire time. I was left with over 12 bruises all over my wrists, neck and hips, some were extremely visible.\n\ni haven't had any contact with my sister since. she has sent me an apology, where she said that she quit drinking and weed and said that she hopes that we can \"start over\". i didn't accept her apology, neither did i ever respond to it. mainly because my sister has an infamous history of fucking up, apologizing then doing the same thing again and again. i wasn't the only one she laid her hands on, after the entire thing happened my dad told me that she was also physically violent towards my mother, aunt and grandmother (who is a full body burn victim). everything that i know from this point on is what i have heard from other family members.\n\nthings were pretty quiet for a few months (no judgement day) until sometime in March my parents told me that Ted and Vanessa are going to court against Isaac. what happened was that for over a year, my sister was complaining that Frank's behavior would change a lot every time he spent time with Isaac, that he would return and start \"misbehaving\". she filed a CPS report on Isaac for child abuse or something of the like. because of the report, Isaac had to come to the country where my sister lives with Ted. during the processing of the report, he got to see Frank. Frank then proceeded to tell Isaac about what Vanessa and Ted have been doing to him and Gary behind the scenes, which Isaac recorded and later sent it to my parents. on the video Frank proceeded to recount what happened to him: apparently after coming back from seeing his father, Frank was misbehaving, and to \"discipline\" him, Ted shoved him into a suitcase, locked it from the outside, put him into the trunk of his car and drove him to the woods. He then took the suitcase out of the trunk (without opening it) and then proceeded to threaten to leave Frank there if he continued to misbehave.\n\nafter this video was sent out, my parents confronted Ted and asked him if this was true, which he confirmed that it did indeed happen. his excuse was that he fully believed that it was a good method of discipline. after that Isaac filed a CPS report against him and my sister, resulting in a court case. when the court date was approaching, my sister an Ted decided to quickly get married and right when CPS was supposed to come and check on their situation at home, my sister fled back to our home country with both Gary and Frank. this resulted in their lawyer to withdraw from the case and for the court to be postponed to the first two weeks of June. a little before this happened, my mom was having a conversation with Isaac about the entire situation, and she mentioned the fact that Ted was also planning to take his own kids to our home country without the knowledge of his ex-wife. Isaac quickly informed his lawyer about that, which got to his ex-wife quickly enough for Ted to lose custody of his children. I'm not sure if he lost custody or if she got a restraining order, but either way he will either get fined 25K euros or go to jail for 7 years if he comes near them.\n\nafter my sister dropped off Gary and Frank with my family, she returned back to where she was living with Ted in order to gather her things and prepare to move back to our home country. a few days ago, my mom called me, saying that she had a realization that Ted is part of a sect and how he has been slowly indoctrinating my sister and especially her kids. i always had a gut feeling about this, considering Ted was a \"devout protestant\" yet essentially did whatever he wanted, as well as the whole new years prophecy incident. there was also a moment i didn't mention during april where Ted texted my family saying that \"Gary and Frank have accepted Jesus as their lord and savior and have chosen the path to eternal heaven,\" which i think was a pivotal moment for everything else that has been happening.\n\nwhat my mom also told me about was what she found out from my sister's kids when they stayed with her. she told me that they were forced to wear bracelets with some kind of inscriptions on them and were never allowed to take them off, even when bathing. how they were no longer allowed to eat pork because it is a dirty animal (which isn't something that is part of traditional protestantism as far as i'm aware?). she told me how Gary never did anything in his free time except read the bible, saying that he wasn't interested in reading anything else, or how he wasn't allowed to buy any new clothes without Vanessa's permission and approval. if that wasn't enough, apparently Ted and Vanessa forced both of them to kneel in front of the bible every evening, and \"tell god\" everything they did during the day, an if they didn't tell the truth, they would get punished. one such punishment included locking Frank in a storage closet long enough for him to start panicking and breaking the door down, or tying up Gary to his bed and not allowing him to get up from the bed for hours, or starving him for days. i could go on and on. every time i call her, my mom tells me something new that the Frank tells her about. unfortunately Gary is far to deep into this, as he calls Vanessa anytime Frank or my mom does something that isn't allowed for them to do.\n\nthe issue with this situation is that everyone in the family agrees that Ted and Vanessa need to be behind bars except my father, who is the only one capable enough to do something about this. he has been acting as a diplomat for the longest time, trying to stay somewhere in the middle between those two child-abusing lunatics and everyone else. my mother has been desperately trying to get through to him and convince him to at least get on board to institutionalize my sister and force Ted to stay somewhere very far away from any of us, but he has been reluctant to get involved in any way.\n\nthis is a really tough situation and i don't even know if i'm allowed to talk about this, but this has been so mentally draining that i needed this to be out there. this has been a blight on our entire family and i have no idea how to even act in this situation. this has effectively taken toll on everyone around us, and now its one of the only things any of us have been talking about. my sister and Ted are now going to move to a secluded part within our home country (he sold literally everything he had in the EU) where they plan to completely cut all contact with everyone else (including never letting Isaac see Frank again) and live in their perfect deluded utopia, while my father sits there and does nothing while telling the rest of us that we and the children are exaggerating and that Ted is a decent guy.\n\nthank you

anything else how he wasnt allowed to buy any new clothe without vanesser permission and approval if that wasnt enough apparently ted and vanesser forced both of them to kneel in front of the bibl every evening and tell god everything they did during the day an if they didnt tell the truth they would get punished on such punishmer included locking frank in storage closet long enough for him to start panicking and breaking the door down tying up gary to his bed and not allowing him to get up from the bed for hour starving him for day could go and every tim call her my mom tell something new that the frank tell her about unfortunately gary is far to deep into thi he calls vanesser anytim frank my mom doe something that isnt allowed for them to do \n\n the issue with thi situation is that everyone in the family agree that ted and vanesser need to be behind bar except my father who i the only one capable enough to do something about thi he has been acting diplomat for the longest tim trying to stay somewher in the middle between thos two childabusing lunatic and everyone else my mother has been desperately trying to get through to him and convince him to at least get board to institutionalize my sister and forcer ted to stay somewher very far away from any of us but he has been relucter to get involved in any way \n\n thi is really tough situation and even know if im allowed to talk about thi but thi has been so mentally draining that needed this to b out there thi has been blight our entir family and have no idea how to even act in thi situation this ha effectively taken toll everyone around us and now it one of the only things any of u have been talking about my sister and ted are now going to move to secluded part within our home country he sold literally everything he had in the where they plan to completely cut all contact with everyone else including never letting isaac se frank again and live in their perfect deluded utopia whil my father sit ther and doe nothing whil telling the rest of us that we and the children ar exaggerating and that ted is decent guy \n\n thank you for reading this if you did \n\n", "author": "Ok-Hand2064",

{"title": "My friend thinks I'm in love with his girlfriend and it's driving me crazy", "content": "Shit, I’m not even sure how to kick this off, but I really need to get something off my chest.  To keep things discreet, I’ll just call the people involved G and L.\n\nSo, there’s me G, L, and M (who isnt super relevant to the story, but I’ll mention him anyway) we’ve been friends for about three years now. For the last two years, G and L have been a couple.\n\nI’ve always felt pretty close to all of them, but about seven months ago, things took a turn: G started feeling insecure and jealous of me.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue why. I’ve always treated all three of them the same and never had any romantic feelings for L. But when they finally came to talk to me (it was L who pushed for the chat since G was reluctant), I listened to everything G had to say. He laid out all the the reasons he thought I liked L shit him even made a list of things he didn’t like about me and I just sat there and listened. Afterward, I shared that I had sensed something was off, even if I couldn’t pinpoint it, and how hurt I felt by G and M, especially since they had started making jokes and whispering behind my back, assuming I had feelings for L. \n\nThat conversation took place at L’s house. Both she and M apologized, but G never did. To make matters worse, while I was being respectful and listening, when it was my turn to speak, G just zoned out and started playing PlayStation. He wouldn’t stop until L took the controller from him, telling him he was being rude.\n\nI really thought everything was settled after that conversation. I made a genuine effort to change any behavior that might have made G uncomfortable, but he pretty much stayed the same… A few months later, while chatting with M and L, they mentioned that G still thought I had feelings for L something I had already suspected since G had stopped talking to me. He would only say something if we were all together, and even then, it was just when absolutely necessary. He also stopped inviting me to hang out.\n\nSo, I figured it was time to talk to him directly. G told me he didn’t believe me and thought nothing had changed. I already knew that because L had mentioned it before. We had another conversation, and once again, I thought we had finally resolved things. For a while, it really felt like we were back to normal.\n\nBut this past Tuesday, G, L, and I went to the mall. At some point during our outing I can’t pinpoint when something shifted. G got moody for the rest of the trip, and when we left the mall, I noticed L was on the verge of tears because of something he said. \n\nSince then, G hasn’t been outright mean, but he’s definitely avoiding me. And L has completely distanced herself, almost like she’s trying to ignore me. It’s driving me crazy because I have no clue what went wrong. Honestly, I’m so tired of dealing with this drama with G. It’s clearly affecting our group, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I really value my friendship with him but I also care about my friendships with L and M.\n\nSo, that’s where I’m at. I just needed to vent a little because i really don’t now what to do anymore and I don’t really have anyone else to talk to: M always sides with G no matter what, L is just as worn out by all this as I am, and my best friend (who I haven’t even mentioned) lives far away and already has a lot on his plate. I don’t want to burden him with my problems too.\n", "cleaned_content": "shit im not even sur how to kick this off but really need to get something off my chest   to keep things discreet ill just call the people involved g and l \n\n so there gramme l and m who isnt super relever to the story boire ill mention him anyway weve been friend for about three year now for the last two year gramme and l have been couple \n\n iv alway felt pretty clos to all of them boire about seven month ago thing took turn g started feeling insecur and jealous of \n\n honestly have no clue why iv alway treated all three of them the same and never had any romantic feeling for l but when they finally came to talk to it wa l who pushed for the chat since gramme was relucter listened to everything gramme had to say he laid out all the the reaser he thought liked l shit him even made list of thing he didnt lik about and just sat there and listened afterward shared that had sensed something was off even if couldnt pinpoint it and how hurt felt by g and m especially since they had started making jokes and whispering behind my back assuming had feeling for l \n\n that conversation took place at ls hous both she and m apologized but gramme never did to make matters wors whil was being respectful and listening when it was my turn to speak gramme just zoned out and started playing playstation h wouldnt until l took the controller from him telling him he was being rude \n\n really thought everything was settled after that conversation made genuin effort to change any behavior that might hav mad gramme uncomfortabl but he pretty much stayed the same few month later whil chatting with m and l they mentioned that g still thought had feeling for l something had already suspected since gramme had stopped talking to he would only say something if we were all together and even then it wer just when absolutely necessary he also stopped inviting to hang out \n\n so figured it was time to talk to him directly gramme told he didnt believ and thought nothing had changed already knew that becaus l had mentioned it before we had another conversation and once again thought we had finally resolved thing for whil it really felt lik we were back to normal \n\n but thi past tuesday g l and wer to the mall at some point during our outing cer pinpoint when something shifted gramme got moody for the rest of the trip and when we left the mall noticed l wa the verger of tear becaus of something he said \n\n since then g hasnt been outright mean boire hes definitely avoiding and l has completely distanced herself almost like she trying to ignorer it driving crazy becaus have no clue what went wrong honestly im so tired of dealing with thi drama with gramme its clearly affecting our group which is exactly what wanted to avoid really valoir my friendship with him but also care about my friendships with l and m \n\n so that where im at just needed to vent little because really now what to do anymore and really hav anyone else to talk to m alway side with gramme no matter what l is just worn out by all thi am and my best friend who haver even mentioned live far away and already has lot his plate wer to burden him with my problem too \n", "author": "Ok_Sheepherder_2569", "date": "2025-06-06T19:22:19", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l4zl6o/my_friend_thinks_im_in_love_with_his_girlfriend/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

{"title": "I don't feel like a person", "content": "(Cw sexual assault)\n\nWhen I was really little, people loved me.  I didn't need anything complicated and I let all my wants slide.  If I was crying I would bite something in my mouth till the hurting was bigger than the sadness and I would stop crying.  The bigger I got, the more complicated.  The harder homework got.  The more stress everyone was in.  I needed more food.  I was expected to do more chores.\n\nThe first time I was suicidal was my 7th birthday.  I was pretty excited for this one, because its a lucky number, I remember that.  It came and I thought all the sad would go away.  I thought 7 would fix everything.  I realized being alive wasn't actually all that great.  I was at my own birthday party, but it wasn't mine, it was my twins.  So I watched my twin play with her friends.  I sat at my twins birthday party, at the park with cake and whatever, you're supposed to feel happy.  I just stared at nothing wondering when the happy was going to happen.  I realized it had been awhile, months.  I decided I didn't particularly like being alive all that much.\n\nThat was around when my parents decided me making physical contact with other humans was inappropriate, as id begun to look female.  I also morphed from \"cute little tyke\" to \"the corner retard\".  I learned how to stare at my feet and be so quiet.  I was always abused and neglected, but I had my twin sister and the flies and mom was nice sometimes and dad forgot to be mean sometimes.  (When flies landed on me I pretended they knew I was a person and were interacting with me on purpose). When dad lost his job he was always home amd always angry.  The house was a hovel before theyd hoarded it.  Everything got steadily worse.  \n\nOnce I started middle school, the other kids picked up on my lack of social grace, lack of confidence, etc.  The untreated asthma was making me black out, combined with 110° hoard listeria fevers, assorted brain damages, and eventually my father decided I needed \"homework help\", so I would do my homework while he stood over me screaming with his whole gigantic chest.  Pointing at the page, spit flying.  Till 3am or until school the next day.  Every day.  No sleep for years.  It fucked my head up.  I saw shit.  I lost the ability to control when I was laughing.  I'd choke when I swallowed water, I'd cough and spit.  I lost balance and had to relearn that, trip by trip.  I lost the ability to control vocal volume and tone.  Lost hand eye coordination.  I had live mildew on my clothes and matted hair and I smelled like hoard and my clothes had holes.  My shoes had holes.  My backpack was from goodwill.  My feet are warped from wearing shoes years past being able to fit my feet in them.  My pinkies hide beneath my other toes, and the nail disappeared into a horrible crevasse.  I walked funny.  I smelled like a junkyard dog.  I talked like a retard.  People would fight over who has to have me on their team or group project.  I'd ask to do the whole project by myself as it was less embarrassing than watching a roomful of kids fight over who would have to be forced to socialize with me.  The bullying was insane.  I wasn't allowed to look at or address other children.  There were like 2 I could interact with, my twin and the girl who decided I was \"below them in the social ladder\" and had to either be gotten rid of or overtly mocked amd ridiculed in public to diffuse the shame of having me near them.  My twin turned into a shitty asshole.  She'd always seen me as a burden but now I had to earn my place as her burden.\n\n  She Regina George'd me in high school.  I got to do her friends homework and was permitted to sit next to them while I did it only if her friends could take turns insulting me, like a piñata full of tears.  I went online and saw porn too young.  I got weird ideas about boundaries and consent.  I got really into real pictures of gore.  I developed violent tendencies. \n\nAt the end of high school I was suicidal.  I forced myself to breathe normally so no one would know I had profound pneumonia (suppressing coughs was just something a tiny kid does to be loved.  No one loves a loud kid)  Mom enrolled me in college.  Figured I'd be dead by then so whatever.  End up going.  The therapist tells me my friends care about my feelings.  I tell my brand new college friends about my feelings.  They literally say \"ew\" out loud.  I run myself ragged trying to earn approval from literally any other breathing human.  Realized itll never come so I drop out.  My health was mondo bad by then, I'd regularly and at random have what doctors have handwaived away as irritable bowel syndrome.  Where I'd explode out both ends until nothing was left, and lie on the communal bathroom floor dry heaving out both ends for hours while people wrinkle their noses and step over me to pee.  One day a disinterested nurse at an ER hands me a pill and its a lot better now.  Dicyclamine.  My mother scolds me for wasting her time.  Told you it wasn't anything real, it went away so fast.  Waste of time.\n\nAt some point a disinterested psychiatrist heard me mention the supernatural things that also harassed me.  You have schizoaffective.  Here's a pill.  Go away.  \n\nDrop out of college.  Mom's hoard or the streets?  Chose moms hoard.  Wrong decision.  Helping me keep my antipsychotics is too much work.  Why do I need those pills anyways?  They made me too independent.  They let me rot.  Then, well since you're here, you should take care of your father to earn your keep.  It was my twin sister who suggested I was using my parents like a parasite and should contribute to dads care.  I put dirt in his food.  Nobody knows that.  I hated him.  I'd stab the backs of furniture that were hidden with knives and pretend it was him.  I lost touch with which screams were flashbacks and which were real.  When they found out about the knives thing, well shit who would have guessed unmedicating a schizophrenic makes them worse?  Homeless shelter for you.\n\nI find this guy online.  Intersex with short arms.  We connect. I've never connected with anyone so I thought it was real.  I genuinely believe that if he was going to sell me we both deserved it by now so whatever I move in across several states.  Never form a support network.  I spend so long pleasuring and living and feeding and cleaning up after this fat useless slob.  He cries when I don't fuck him.  Don't I love him?  I do.  So I fuck him.  He stops doing even the token \"love\" shit and the sex feels wrong so I stop.  Its been 5 years.  I find out he doesn't love me, never loved me.  He just can't reach his own junk and doesn't believe his own compliments.  A teddy bear with a talk button and a trip to the adult toy store could have done what I was to him.\n\nNow I'm crying.  I'm in an apartment with people who say I'm their friends just cause they don't know me well enough.  I don't think I have a soul.  Souls add value to the world.  I just subtract.  Everything I faked to make people think I was good enough to not hurt has crumbled away like black mold.  I can't be kind any more.  I gave it all away and all I have are pith and cowering and hate and thirty years of tears I never cried.  He made sure I had no human connections.  I don't even have those.  Not even a handful of people.  Like 3 have ever really truly loved me, or thought they did, and one of them just wanted me the way a toddler wants a toy.  I can't even just cower.  I want to lie flat.  I want to be so boring and uninteresting the universe stops hating me.  I want to rest.  I want to be loved.  I want to die.  I don't even form preferences any more.  I don't expect things any more.  Nothing i do or am will ever be good enough.  My twin sister said it best.

She had just gotten out of a 10 year relationship with a ring. I even told her she should be single for a while, but we had a strong connection, and eventually she asked if we could be exclusive. I said yes. Around that time, some women from my past started popping up again flings, people I used to talk to. I never shut them down. Not because I wanted anything to happen, but because deep down, I was afraid Samantha wasn’t serious about me. I thought maybe I was just her way out of her engagement, and I didn’t want to go all in just to get hurt. We got close fast. I started staying at her place almost every day. One night we were out at her friends party, drinking and I got a snap from one of those women. I didn’t reply, but I did something I’m still ashamed of I took a photo. A revealing one. I never sent it. The second I took it, it felt wrong. I didn’t even save it or look at it again. But I left my phone out, and Samantha found it. She didn’t see the messages just the photo. I panicked and lied, told her I was going to send it to her, which wasn’t true. She didn’t fight me on it, but I could tell something shifted after that. She stopped trusting me. And honestly, I stopped trusting myself a little too. Eventually, we talked about it again. I told her the truth I took the photo but didn’t send it. I didn’t cheat, but I wasn’t innocent either. She told me she felt stupid for believing in me. And I get it. We stayed close still friends, still doing things that felt like we were more than that. We hooked up sometimes. But a few months ago, she told me she didn’t want a romantic relationship anymore. I agreed to just be friends because I didn’t want to lose her completely, even though it was already breaking me. Since then, I’ve found out she was on Tinder and Snapchat, probably hooking up. She posts flirty stuff online. We still go places together sometimes, but I don’t sleep over anymore. Our conversations are surface level. She’s moving on, and I’m still stuck in love with her. i know I messed up. I didn’t cheat, but I made a decision I can’t take back. I lost her trust, and I don’t blame her. But I also know I truly cared for her still do. And watching her move on while I’m stuck in limbo is quietly destroying me. Some days I do okay. Other days, I feel like I’m grieving someone who’s still here.

{"title": "It's tough to stay off p*rnography when you're a super virgin", "content": "A few months ago ( I think ) I made a post here telling how I quit porn and masturbation. I was so happy and proud of myself for doing so, and like I said in that post, it was surprisingly easy. But unfortunately I had a relapse. \n\nI know that's kinda part of the process and that I shouldn't feel so bad about it, but it's been harder than before, so inevitably I get a little disappointed with myself from time to times. Specially cause I had no reason to start watching porn again. I was fine, completely fine and we'll. But one day I just felt like challenging me? Like... \"I'll watch some now, it won't be that bad. I stopped once so I can stop again whenever I want\" but OBVIOUSLY that's NOT that simple. \n\nSo last week I decided to quit that again. Not only porn but masturbation as well. Don't get me wrong, masturbation can be healthy, both for men and women, but don't make this a habit. Specially if you have a partner or just an sexually active life. You don't need this. Porn in other hand... It won't provide you anything good. There's no good side on watching porn, so LEAVE IT ASAP.\n\nBut anyways... Keeping my hands off my ✨reproductive organ✨ for at least 2 or 3 weeks worked really well for me the first time I quit pornography. I felt real better, healthier, more disciplined, more active... So that's what I'm doing again. \n( Disclaimer: no, you won't turn into a fucking X-Men simply for stopping masturbating all the damn time like some redpill lunatic would tell you. We do not live in an anime ) \n\nThe problem is... I'm a huge virgin. I don't have any reasons to be THIS virgin ( maybe just my social anxiety but still ), but unfortunately I'm in a nun level of virginity. I guess MAYBE Holy Mary could beat me in virgin competition but I still have my doubts about it.\n\nAnd why would that be a problem? I'll try to explain it in the most direct way possible... I'm not masturbating anymore so... How tf else would i find some \"relief\" in times of... Extra excitement...? Y'know what I'm saying? \n\nNow I feel super needy and uh... Horny '-' and the only thing I can do about it is waiting for this wave of \"emotion\" to pass. That's nothing new to me tho, first time I quit masturbation I had to pass through this too ( obviously ) and that's what made me feel more disciplined, cause y'know... I learned that urges eventually go away. So just be patient. It's not like I'm hungry y'know? At least not literally '-' Anyways, I feel like a monk. \n\nBut back to the main subject, it's tough to have to deal with it being a super virgin. And like I said before, I have no reason to be like that. I'm an adult young man, I'm not an incel weirdo, I'm not ugly, I'm tall, and modesty apart? I'm pretty handsome ( I feel ridiculous saying this lmao ), I have girls interested in hanging out with me and everything, but I'm insecure...\n\nI have a lot of reasons to feel like that. I am extremely shy ( diagnosed with social anxiety ), I feel insecure for being unemployed, I feel insecure for not having as many experiences as some in my age usually have... And that obviously includes sex.\n\nI am 21 and I'm still a giga virgin. I know I shouldn't lose my head over this, and that this is no real issue and blablabla but it still makes me insecure. Not to mention the damage that porn rid to me and to every person that consumed this shit at a young age: The illusions.\n\nIf you gas contact with pornography at a young age, you were probably fooled into thinking that THAT was sex. You were probably fooled into thinking you're somehow not enough. That you're not pretty enough, that you're not attractive enough, that you don't have the right size, the right shapes, colours, attitudes... Not to mention the weird shit porn got us into liking. \n( Btw, if you're addicted enough to the point of losing interest in regular stuff, a couple weeks without touching your thing should solve this problem ) \n\nAnyways, I feel like a teenage boy again and just wanted to put it off my chest. If someone's reading this, I hope you get somehow get inspired to quit that shit too, or at least that you had a few laughs while reading this. \n\nIf you're struggling with this too, I wish you good luck and all the best. If you're happened to be a parent, do your best to keep your kids away from pornography, and I mean ANY kind of pornography. Videos, social media accounts, books... Every kind. Everyone can be a victim to this filthy industry, not only young boys but girls too, so make them aware of how disgusting this industry is and keep em safe.\n\nAll the best, everyone '3'", "cleaned_content": "few month ago   think   made post here telling how quit porn and masturbation . was so happy and proud of myself for doing so , and lik said in that post , it was surprisingly easy . but unfortunately had relapse . \n\n know that' s kinda part of the process and that shouldn' t feel so bad about it , but it' s been harder than before , so inevitably get little disappointed with myself from time to times . specially cause had no reason to start watching porn again . was fin , completely fine and we' ll . but on day just felt like challenging ? like ... i' ll watch some now , it won' t be that bad . stopped once so can again whenever wer but obviously that' s not that simple . \n\n so last week decided to quit that again . not only porn but masturbation well . don' t get wrong , masturbation can be healthy , both for men and women , but don' t mak thi habit . specially if you hav partner just an sexually actif life . you don' t need thi . porn in other hand ... it won' t provide you anything good . there' s no good side watching porn , so leave it asap . \n\n but anyway ... keeping my hand off my reproductif organ for at least 2 3 weeks worked really well for the first tim quit pornography . felt real better , healthier , more disciplined , more actif ... so that' s what i' m doing again . \n  disclaimer no , you won' t turn into fucking xmen simply for stopping masturbating all the damn time lik some redpill lunatic would tell you . we do not live in an anime  \n\n the problem is ... i' m huge virgin . don' t have any reaser to b thi virgin   maybe just my social anxiety but still , but unfortunately i' m in nun level of virginity . gues mayb holy mary could beat in virgin competition but still hav my doubt about it . \n\n and why would that be problem ? i' ll try to explain it in the most direct way ... i' m not masturbating anymore so ... how tf else would find some relief in time of ... extra excitement ... ? y' know what i' m saying ? \n\n now feel super needy and uh ... horny '' and the only thing can do about it i waiting for thi wav of emotion to pass . that' s nothing new to tho , first tim quit masturbation had to pas through thi too   obviously   and that' s what made feel more disciplined , cause y' know ... learned that urge eventually go away . so just b patient . it' s not lik i' m hungry y' know ? at least not literally '' anyway , feel lik monk . \n\n but back to the main subject , it' s tough to have to deal with it being super virgin . and lik said before , have no reason to b lik that . i' m an adult young man , i' m not an incel weirdo , i' m not ugly , i' m tall , and modesty apart ? i' m pretty handsome   feel ridiculous saying this lmao , have girl interested in hanging out with and everything , but i' m insecure ... \n\n have lot of reason to feel lik that . am extremely shy   diagnosed with social anxiety , feel insecur for being unemployed , feel insecur for not having many experience some in my age usually have ... and that obviously include sex . \n\n am 21 and i' m still giger virgin . know shouldn' t lose my head over thi , and that thi is no real issu and blablabla but it still makes insecur . not to mention the damage that porn rid to and to every person that consumed thi shit at young age the illusion . \n\n if you ga contact with pornography at young age , you were probably fooled into thinking that that was se . you were probably fooled into thinking you' r somehow not enough . that you' r not pretty enough , that you' r not attractif enough , that you don' t have the right size , the right shape , colour , attitude ... not to mention the weird shit porn got us into liking . \n  btw , if you' r addicted enough to the point of losing interest in regular stuff , couple weeks without touching your thing should solv thi problem  \n\n anyway , feel lik teenage boy again and just wanted to put it off my chest . if someone' s reading thi , hope you get somehow get inspired to quit that shit too , at least that you had few laugh whil reading thi . \n\n if you' r struggling with thi too , wish you good luck and all the best . if you' r happened to b parer , do your best to keep your kid away from pornography , and mean any kind of pornography . videos , social media account , book ... every kind . everyone can be victim to thi filthy industry , not only young boy but girl too , so make them aware of how disgusting thi industry is and keep em saf . \n\n all the best , everyone ' 3 '", "author": "Unseen_DanJo", "date": "2025-06-07T02:35:14", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l596u4/its_tough_to_stay_off_prnography_when_youre_a/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "neutre", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

My family has recently gone through a crisis where the majority of the family got hospitalized just a couple days after I crashed out at my friend's.\n\nTo give some context, I met these people at my local card shop as I am a returning Yu-Gi-Oh player. I came back to the game last year as I wanted to start fresh from everything that happened to me before (I'll get to that later on), and as time went on, I had the chance to meet and befriend many of my fellow players. Three of whom I have grown extremely close to. These three individuals were people whom I thought I could fully trust.\n\nI went ahead and told all three of them a very, very, very sensitive topic that involved me and a girl whom I went on a date with 3 years ago, as of this writing. To give context about this topic, three years ago. I was on a date with this one girl who was a mutual friend of my ex-friend. I met her at a mall. We got to know one another, and during the date, things escalated, and near the end of the date, she wanted to try things with me. Given how it was my first time and how inexperienced I was, I allowed it to escalate. To put things short, we were involved in sexual activities, and given how I wanted to try foreplay for the first time, I went ahead with it. However, the girl whose idea was behind this whole thing playfully said to me \"Nooo\" as I was conducting foreplay with her. Given how she was on her period, it was pretty messy. As the date came to a close, we went our separate ways, and later that night she wanted to do sexting for the first time.\n\nI have never done anything about it, so I went through with it. Halfway through the session, she blocks me off from everything. Later on, when I was dating my ex. I was told about the entire side of the incident. I only remembered as much as I could at the time, given how fast everything went. This made me believe I unintentionally SA'd someone and I felt very guilty for it. Later on, we made up with what happened and both of us agreed that it was a misunderstanding, miscommunication and we didn't know what we really wanted.\n\nThis date has affected me deeply as everyone was telling me that I assaulted her, which given how young and inexperienced I was I firmly believed that I did something horrific. It wasn't until when I met those three friends of mine was when I decided that I would open up to them about my past. All of them told me that it was not my fault and that it was the girl's idea to keep it going and although I am grateful for them clearing everything up for me, it did open the door of this potentially getting leaked to the public as this is one of my very close guarded secrets.\n\nAnd fast forward till now, shortly after my family crisis and after I snapped at my group of friends it wasn't until recently where I got a message from another friend of mine who I did NOT tell him this ask me if I quote on quote \"forced myself onto a girl\" recently as there was a nasty rumor that started going around at our local card shop about me yesterday.\n\nAs soon as he asked me this, I knew immediately who it was. Given that I only told three people about this. The first one who I was very, very close with was present at the card shop that day, along with the third closest friend who I know for a fact didn't tell everyone (I got confirmation by him when he sent me a very hostile message saying that I should leave him alone and that he heard everything) my 2nd close friend is not from the local area we are in so that leaves close friend number one.\n\nI don't have to even confront him about this because my gut is telling me that he is most likely the person who started spreading this rumor. The very same friend who I told in full confidence thinking that he would never tell anyone else this because if word got out and someone were to twist the words, this is something that could ruin my life and safe to say that it has.\n\nNow that everyone at the card shop knows about this, they believed I am someone who committed SA even though I didn't do such thing which was also confirmed by my therapist when I originally told him this last year. Thankfully, this has not spread online yet but given how it only takes one person to call me out online, like what happened to me last year in a separate community where I was once associated with someone who did in fact SA someone and I was guilty by association.\n\nI am extremely both afraid and paranoid for my well-being. I’ve started therapy again and I’m trying to hold on. But I feel unsafe in every space I used to feel comfortable in. I don’t know where to go, who to talk to, or what to do if people confront me. I’ve been told to lay low, but I worry that my silence makes me look guilty. And yet, I don’t want to keep explaining myself to people who’ve already made up their minds about me.\n\nI really hate talking about this again as this is something that I thought I would never have to bring up ever again but given my current predicament I am left with little to no choice. With this rumor spreading around, I don't really know where to proceed as I really do not want to leave this community again. I also feel like history is repeating itself and that the sins of my past have come to haunt me once again.\n\nI'd like to apologize for the extremely long post but I have a LOT to get off my chest and unpack.

{"title": "my partner talked to their therapist about my SA", "content": "Kind of what the title says. A year or two ago, I was sexually assaulted by my partner. For clarity, consent between us has always been a bit unclear, but we kind of just rolled with whatever happened. That time however was different, and I was not comfortable at all, and it was very violating. I pushed them off of me after a few minutes and sent them home. At the time, when I opened up about how I was feeling regarding what had happened, I received a lot of apologies and support from them, and I felt better regarding what happened. we had a big conversation on consent and what that looks like, as they weren't aware that I was not consenting then.\n\nit's still something that affects me a lot. every time I walk besides the spot in my home it happened I remember it. it's awful, and I wouldn't wish it in anyone. I feel sick just thinking about it. We have done a lot since then to work and build trust back- it was a one time occurrence and I full heartedly believe it will stay a one time thing. However, something happened a few days ago where they got in my lap on top of me and I was in the corner of the wall and I froze. they caught on immediately that I didn't want to do anything and got off of me, but it took be back to that moment way back and I went home quickly after that. we had a conversation about it, and I explained how I felt, and they tried their best to comfort me, but I could tell it hurt them. they are so kind and compassionate. they would never want to hurt me on purpose (please trust me on this) and what happened all that time ago was an unfortunate misunderstanding. they're just really, really bad at understanding social cues.\n\nthey have recently started going to therapy, and today near the end of their session, they described what happened between us as if it was two of their friends, because it was weighing heavily on their mind. their therapist called the \"friend\" a rapist, and no intention behind the action mattered as it was still rape. he went on to say \"I would beat the fuck out of a guy like that.\" their therapist has a little sister and is extremely protective of her, which is why he was so blunt. when my partner told me this, they were really, really sad about it. I told them to tell their therapist that it was us and not their friends, because a therapist is supposed to help you grow and heal. their next session was supposed to be Sunday, but they ended up moving it to tomorrow morning, and I am really nervous.\n\nI love my partner. while I'm still hurting over what happened, nothing will change about how I feel about them. I don't want them to be hurt by what their therapist will tell them, because they already have a lot of shit going on. I wanted them to wait until they felt ready to talk about it, but they just want to rip the band aid off. I am scared I might have caused a rift between them and their therapist, but I am hoping that there's some sympathy in his heart. I know it sounds like I'm downplaying what happened- hell I probably am- but I know them like I know the back of my hand. I know they did what they did because they wanted me to feel good- not because they told me, but because I know who they are. it's so hard to explain to an audience that wasn't there when it happened.\n\nI am scared for them. I know I should feel a little less sympathetic in this situation, but I feel like we have both grown up so much since then. I've learned to speak up for myself and say no when I don't want to do something instead of beating around the bush with \"I don't know\"s. not that that makes it any less of an assault, but it helps me rationalize it. they've learned since then to ask if I seem unsure (we still do spontaneous sex- I just prefer the way we do it now over asking straight up every time). I don't know, I am just afraid. I have never ever framed what happened to me as rape and I never want to, nor would I ever want to think of my partner as a rapist. it sucks. I know they didn't mean it. I really do. but it still sucks. I know what the therapist is going to tell them tomorrow is going to be true, but I am afraid for their mental health. they had the same kind of assault happen to them in a relationship before ours, and they've repeatedly said before anything happened that they would hate to make anyone feel the way they did. but now they have. so. I don't know.\n\nI love them a lot. I forgive them for everything. I don't even tie them to what happened to me.

Just to know that someone hears me bc I feel extremely alone in this life of mine. \n\n\n* Saying less ( sticking up for myself, vouching for my opinion, upholding right vs wrong in my eyes or even general public/common sense, controversial opinions avoid all together ). Never gossip. Explaining my true feelings (Being immediately or even long term transparent as to what’s truly on my mind). don’t speak unless spoken to. Don’t offer piece of mind or perception. Even if asked for \n* Avoidance (people, places, objects, activities, relationships) don’t make eye contact, it invites everything.  Don’t stare, ever. Don’t look anywhere aside from the floor, ceiling, yourself, or the distance. Stay shy to avoid embarrassment, not taking initiative for verbal explanation, don’t hang out with anyone, stay home, don’t put yourself out there. Don’t try to stand out. Stick to yourself. Mind your business. \n* Doing less (actions: unwarranted, unasked for, unexpected, criticized/ridiculed(could do better), even if I know it’s “right” “may help” “could be an effective solution”. Never expect to get in line first, it never ends positively. Don’t offer advice or guidance. \n* Trying too hard: stay agreeable to avoid confrontation. Make extensive additional effort to gain positive reinforcement at the expense of my own time and energy and resources. Even if sacrificing my own needs in order to do so. \n* Asking too much: don’t ask questions, don’t ask for Opinions, don’t ask for understanding. Don’t ask for patience, don’t ask for leniency , don’t ask for favors. Don’t ask personal questions. NEVER expect anything from anyone. Ever. Don’t ask for even the minuscule favors - it always leads to deeper rooted closeted problems. Don’t ask for help in general - it will be met with what others have all done for you and how you have no right to ask for anything or expect anything, much less assume they will do anything out of their own kindness or consideration.

Don’t tell others about your struggles. Don’t play off to be easily taken advantage of. Don’t express your interests or hobbies. Or try to encourage others to do anything. \n* Don’t be vulnerable. Don’t open up. Don’t try to make connections. Keep to yourself. Don’t show true intentions that you want to help or need it yourself. Don’t explain intense or even general feelings. Past experiences. Don’t try to sympathize or empathize. Don’t fully open up about anything at all. \n* Don’t take sides, ever. \n* Don’t show any outward emotion at all - happy, sad, scared, upset, confused. Even lack of emotion warrants anger and disagreement. Avoid all facial expression or eye contact whatsoever. DONT CRY especially, no one cares and it’s seen as baby behavior and irrational. \n* Don’t insert yourself into anything: conversation, assumption, questions, ultimatums, others beliefs, morals, drives, or hobbies. Even when warranted, best to steer clear of any inclusion. \n* My body: don’t get tattoos, they’re seen as delinquent. Don’t get piercings, they’re seen as slutty, asking for sex, secular. Don’t wear jewelry. Don’t have body piercings, they’re whorish and ugly. Don’t dye or do my hair, it’s seen as asking for compliments or excessive. At the same time, don’t completely disregard hygiene and do the most minimal - it’s seen as neglect, poor hygiene, laziness. Don’t miss a day brushing teeth, showering, washing hair, washing hands, washing feet, washing face, wearing clean and freshly folded/hung clothes \n* Don’t assume you are owed a single thing.

{"title": "Broke up 1 year ago and can’t f-ing move on.", "content": "Let me start from the beginning. \n\n\nOct 2023, I (20M at the time) pretty fresh after a break up with (19M at the time) year old ex boyfriend of a year and a half. \n\nWith my depression hitting hard and working nonstop during uni, my sleep schedule was f-ed up.\n\nSo I casually woke up at 4 am and my best thoughts brought me to scrolling through Grindr. There weren’t a lot of gay people in the area where I lived back then, and I was surprised to see a profile I’ve never seen before. Online, even more surprising. Decided to approach. \n\n“Hey”\n\n“Hi”\n\n“Why are u up so late/early?”\n\n“Just woke up from some random noise and couldn’t get back to sleep. And you?”\n\n“Sleep’s schedule’s f-ed.” \n\n-I send my pics-\n\n“You’re cute :)”\n\n-Sends his pics-\n\n-I realize he has the prettiest f-ing smile-\n\n“I’ve never seen you here. New?”\n\n“I’m visiting family. Should I pay a visit to u too?”\n\n\nIf it was some random guy, this would be a random hook up, and we’d never randomly talk and see each other ever again. But it was HIM. \nHe had the most beautiful smile. We shared stories, we realized we’re very alike and we overall realized we really like each other. \nAfter a very long hookup session we went to have breakfast together (it was noon already). Then, we had something sweet together. He even met my best friend from uni. We held hands. We kissed passionately a lot.\n\nI fell hard. \n\nHe lived far from me. That didn’t stop us from face-timing every night. Having game nights together. Sharing every second we could together (although it was online).\nI loved him so f-ing much. \nI asked him to be my new year’s date. He agreed. \nI asked him if he’d like us to go to our first party together. He agreed. \nI asked him if he’d be my new year’s kiss. He kissed me heavenly. \n\nNote however, that we never actually “dated”. He was afraid of getting hurt, but he loved me as well, he felt comfortable with us just being very close. \nI hated it. I lived with it. \n\nOne month later, big fight with his mom again.\nHe moved in with me. \nI felt like I was dreaming. Soon that dream became my love’s nightmare. \n\nSlowly I became more jealous. I was a stalker. I disgust myself until this day. \nI was toxic. I said stuff I shouldn’t have said. He did nothing to have that kind of treatment from me. \nMy best guess is that I just acted the way my mother used to talk and do with me. Still, it is all my fault. It’s not like I had to be a jerk, it’s just what I’d known from past traumas and shit I guess. \nHe’d forgiven me again and again when I hurt him. \n\nOn May 15th he did something unforgivable. He brought someone to my apartment to hook up with.\nWe agreed that we can hook up with other people since we’re not together, but we can’t bring a stranger into mine and his safe home. \n\nMorning of May 16th. \n\n“I knew something was off. I looked in your phone. Why did you tell him our address, and apartment, if he didn’t come here?”\n\n“You looked through my phone..?”\n\n“Yea..”\n\n“I f-ing knew it.”\n\n“You broke your promise.” \n\n“You looked through my private stuff!”\n\n“You brought someone to my only safe place in the world, the place I let you in because I f-ing love you like nothing and no one in this world!”\n\n\nI cried during that whole day.\nI couldn’t stop crying. \nI love that mf. Why did he hurt me like this? Maybe it’s because I hurt him again and again and that made him distant?\nHe left for a couple of hours that day. \nWhen I finally calmed down, he’d just come back. \nI opened the door. My eyes were wet but I wasn’t crying.\nHis eyes were sad. \nI said “I’m sorry. Please come in.”\nHe came in. He’d just looked and me and burst into tears. “I shouldn’t have done it, I’m sorry.” \n“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have looked through your phone.”\nWe bought snacks and watched a movie until his mom had come to pick him up. We’d agreed earlier that week that he’d live a week with me and a week with her, since she’s a little sick and even though they weren’t getting along, he knew he had to help her. \nHowever, he took all of his stuff. \nMy apartment felt empty without his stuff. Without him. \n\n“It’s crazy. I can’t fall asleep without you.”\n“It’s ok, love. We made up, remember? We’re good. Get some sleep, it was a crazy day. 🤎”\n\nNow you must be thinking “y’all made up so what’s the problem?”\nRemember I told you I was crazy like my mom? Well, that’s where it REALLY hits. \nHe wouldn’t answer my for the whole day, every day, for 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks I’d have gone crazy. Spamming him with messages (100 messages in like 10 minutes), calling him nonstop like crazy. And he’d just ignored me.\nHe asked me for some time to heal. He needed to reflect on all that happened. But I was just going f-ing mad. \n\nNight of May 31st. \n“Hey. I thought about it a lot. I thank you for all you have done for me and forever appreciated. But I can’t continue talking to you. Look at what it’s doing to you. And I don’t want to keep getting hurt from your words and from what you’re doing to me AND to you. Bye and good luck in everything 🤎”\n“Wait please don’t”\n“Please don’t make it harder. Don’t make me block you”\nI kept on begging. \nAnd I got blocked EVERYWHERE. \n\n4 months of waking up, crying, going to study, going to work, holding myself from crying everywhere, falling asleep in tears, and again. \n\n\nThere’s a little more to this story. Like how we had a chat and he took some time to think whether he’d like to get in contact with me again, eventually saying: “sorry, I can’t.”\n\nI deleted Instagram since, not wanting to see him or his chat again, also most social media was deleted with it. \nI do download it sometimes to look at his profile (guess he unblocked me since) and I see him and the progress and changes he’s gone through. \n\nI can’t get into a relationship. I always think about him. I’m so in love with him and I miss him so fucking much. I wish I could hug him again. Make him smile like I did in the beginning.\n\nBut I can’t. \n\nI can’t move on. \n\nI can’t stop thinking about him. \n\nAnd I’m afraid to ever stop loving him. \n\nI’m so stuck on him and I don’t know what to do.\nI don’t think he feels the same way.

{"title": "If you’ll have me, I want to share the story of the greatest summer and year of my life with you all. Maybe it will inspire you.", "content": "The story of the Summer (and year) I’ll never forget.\n\nIt was the end of the spring semester in 2016. I was finishing up junior year of college. I was a very blessed young man in every way. My grandfather had bought me a new computer because he’s just that sweet, and I was learning how to be a 3D drafter. But I also was making a decision to stop looking for a girlfriend at the time. It hurt, but I was tired of letting my happiness rest on that. So I ripped the band aid off. I started just enjoying life however I could and writing my own music and recording whenever I could. My trusty iPhone 6 and my iPad Air 2 got about 3 years worth of use in one summer. Cut to the actual story-\n\nIt was now May, and I was enjoying the relief of all final exams and projects being over. Now I just had to work part time and do whatever else I wanted. One day, and I can’t even remember the fine details, a couple of old high school friends of mine and a work friend who they’d never met before all ended up in a group chat together. We struck up a brand new group friendship instantly. We started talking about hanging out together as soon as possible. So that’s what we did. We could see eachother like once a week and sometimes less with work schedules. I still remember every day like it was yesterday. \n\nDay 1 of hanging out. We went to my friend Andrew’s house and crammed into his crown Vic for a drive around the sticks of Indiana. I’ve never seen so many open fields in my life despite always living close by. Pair that up with hilarious banter among eachother and parody songs on the aux as we shared it. In the evening, the sun was setting and we were down by a lake that was well sheltered and that was a good thing because it started raining. Rather than run back to the car, we just sat there and talked about life. It was like a movie. \n\nIf day 1 was a movie, day 2 was an even better movie. Andrew, after a good dose of memes, told us in the group chat he wanted to show us something. We met up at some shady (but good!) gas station deli at the edge of town and ate sandwiches that had no business being that good, especially not at that hour. Remember, pre-covid. Stuff was open late. So off we went in the crown Vic that may as well have been a Maserati. We went past the deserted golf course and through multiple one horse towns. And sure enough, in the distance there was a thin gravel road going up at a 45 degree angle. Andrew floors it and we were kicking up rocks to scale that thing. After a few minutes that seemed like hours, we had scaled that biatch of a road. Ever curious, my friend Zach (who hadn’t lived in America that long) got right out of the car and looked at what Andrew wanted to show us. “WHOA” he audibly shouts. And I looked out over that expanse and saw nothing but the tops of trees for miles. We were on a high cliff overlooking Bumf**k Indiana, and it was sending chills down my spine. Core memory man. We sat out over the edge with our guitars, screaming to hear the echoes. If I can find the original voice recordings, I’ll post them. After more time sitting and talking, we went back to our hometown and ended the night chilling at our local Wendy’s before going home around 1:30am. What a night.\n\nDay 3. This one was a slow and relaxing one. We just met up in Zach’s garage and made our first steps to writing music together. Wayne, who I haven’t mentioned by name yet, was only singing at the time. We were teaching him guitar little by little. That day, Andrew finished his little love song that I still play sometimes to this day. Maybe I’ll post that too if I ever get permission.\n\nDay 4. This was what you’d expect from your typical 19 and 20 year olds. We just drove around more and stopped in rural Kentucky where we rarely went. This was the day I got back my grade on my final project and I remember being vaguely satisfied with it. Life was once again just good overall. \n\nDay 5. This was a big day for me. Because not only was it another week seeing my boys, but we invited our friend Nicole along to go to guitar center with us. My crush. But no one knew that 😉. I picked up everyone and squeezed them into my clapped out Volkswagen Passat and off we went. I still have recordings of us singing and playing one of our original songs in the “expensive guitar room”. We laughed and talked about good times on the way back and we even very immaturely laughed at a poorly printed billboard. Andrew saw the billboard which said “#1 in tires, #1 in service” and recited it in a caveman voice as “I in tires, I in service!” If you couldn’t tell I’m autistic as shit by now, wow.\n\nDay 6, a bittersweet one. This was a cookout and campfire at Andrew’s place. Upon arriving there, Nicole ran to me and leaped into my one free arm, with my guitar case in the other. I thought for sure I had a chance with her lol. We threw the cheap ass Kroger burgers over the fire and I was asked to pay Everlong by my friends. What a moment, once again. Even just typing this I can’t believe how lucky I was to have experienced a summer like this. I hope that Rogue acoustic guitar is happy somewhere in the world and knows I regret selling her. The night ended with me asking out Nicole. She said she only saw us as friends, but it was okay for once. I wasn’t too upset and we shared a nice hug. It was the last time I saw her until Fall. \n\nDay 7. This time, it was my (aka my parents) turn to host everyone. God bless my mom and dad. We all watched Air Force One together and then played Cards Against Humanity. A favorite moment of mine was when Zach asked what “revenge f**king” was and then Wayne did an air humping motion and said in a Batman voice “you. Killed. My. Parents.” We all cracked up. This was also the night we randomly realized something- Our most listened to album BY FAR on all our little road trips was Here’s to the Good Times by Florida Georgia Line. And that gave us an idea. \n\nDay 8. It was my mom and dad’s house again. But today it was going to be a set plan. We were going to make our very own cover of “cruise” by Florida Georgia Line. I would handle lead guitar and vocal harmonies, while Zach and Andrew shared lead vocals and rhythm guitar parts. Wayne would handle Nelly’s verses. We spent all day recording on my iPad using nothing but the built in mic and a cheap guitar headphone jack adapter. It all went off without a hitch and we said bye for the day as I spent from 6pm to midnight editing it all. The finished product was not too shabby for a group of 19 and 20 year old rednecks in Indiana. I sent it in the group chat and they went ballistic. They were psyched at how good it sounded. We had finally made music together and recorded it the best we could. \n\nDay 9. Our only plans were to just meet up and hangout again or possibly put a ton of miles on one of our cars on a good old cross country drive. And that’s exactly how the day started. We were driving in the middle of nowhere when we came across the banks of the Ohio River in Kentucky. I randomly had an idea. I pulled up the selfie cam in Snapchat on my phone and asked Zach to play our recording through this phone so we could lip sync it in front of the river. And boom- the idea to make a music video was born. So we hopped right in the car and turned the dash cam setup around to face us. And we lip synced our cover of cruise to make a music video while driving down the forgotten backroads of Kentuckiana. And for those fleeting moments, all was absolutely perfect in my soul. I was no longer angry that I wasn’t popular in school. I was no longer hurt by the rejection that followed me so long. I was no longer worried about what tomorrow would bring. I had a PURPOSE. And it brought me a kind of peace I can’t do enough justice to put in any song. I think that was peak life. We all went home walking on air, and I began editing the video. \n\nMorning came. It was the first day of Fall classes for me, but I knew it would be chill because I already had rapport with all the professors. The video was done and it was time to post it on Facebook. So I did it right before my first two classes and didn’t think too much about the reception. I was just proud of what we did together. My phone stayed in my pocket for the next two hours but I pulled out my iPad for an assignment and saw multiple Facebook messages including the group chat. The boys basically said every one of their friends and acquaintances had already liked the video and commented that we sounded great! So I checked my phone and it was taking off! Like 30 shares and a thousand views and so many comments from people I knew past and present. Throughout the day it just kept going and going! When me and the guys met up that night we were practically fist pumping and high fiving. The video had 70 or so shares and tons of views for our standards. We kept getting messages from locals we barely knew and that was our day of fame for damn sure. We blasted the song on our car speakers around the town square and headed to get pizza to celebrate in Kentucky and we were the happiest we’d been in years. The night went on and it was more sight seeing, funny moments and just every beautiful thing about growing up in the country. This was our last night together. \n\nEpilogue:\n\nSummer was over. Andrew got a full time job in another town. Zach moved back to his home country, with plans to visit 2x a year or so. Wayne enlisted in the Navy and dropped off the face of the earth. I missed my friends so badly. But the rest of the year continued to be great. Better than I could have ever deserved. Nicole and I reunited and made a music video and song together. The video never saw the light of day, but the song itself did. Reception to it was good but nothing matched what the boys and I accomplished that summer. I saw movies with my brother and parents. I got As and Bs for the semester for the first time in years. Christmas was even better. I thanked God for that summer with my friends and family. I’ve tried for 9+ years to make a reunion happen but I’m afraid it’s just not in the cards. Yet. \n\nI am truly a very lucky man and I will never forget this summer no matter how old I am. Thank you all so much for sharing this with me. \n", "cleaned_content": "the story of the summer and year ill never forget . \n\n it was the end of the spring semester in 2016 . wa finishing up junior year of college . was very blessed young man in every way . my grandfather had bought new computer because he just that sweet , and wa learning how to b 3d drafter . but also was making decision to looking for girlfriend at the tim . it hurt , but wa tired of letting my happiness rest that . so ripped the band aid off . started just enjoying lif however could and writing my own music and recording whenever could . my trusty iphon 6 and my ipad air 2 got about 3 year worth of us in one summer . cut to the actual story \n\n it was now may , and wa enjoying the relief of all final examen and project being over . now just had to work part time and do whatever else wanted . one day , and cer even remember the fine detail , couple of old high school friend of mine and work friend who theyd never mettre before all ended up in group chat together . we struck up brand new group friendship instantly . we started talking about hanging out together soon . so thats what we did . we could see eachother lik once week and sometime les with work schedule . still remember every day lik it was yesterday . \n\n day 1 of hanging out . we wer to my friend andrews hous and crammed into his crown vic for driv around the stick of indiana . iv never seen so many open fields in my life despite alway living clore by . pair that up with hilariou banter among eachother and parody song the we shared it . in the evening , the sun was setting and we were down by lak that wa well sheltered and that was good thing because it started raining . rather than run back to the , we just sat there and talked about life . it was like movie . \n\n if day 1 wa movie , day 2 wa an even better movie . andrew , after good dose of , told us in the group chat he wanted to show us something . we mettre up at some shady but good ! ga station deli at the edge of town and at sandwich that had no business being that good , especially not at that hour . remember , precovid . stuff wa open late . so off we went in the crown vic that may well have been maserati . we wer past the deserted golf cours and through multiple one hors town . and sur enough , in the distance ther was thin gravel road going up at 45 degree angle . andrew floors it and we were kicking up rock to scale that thing . after few minute that seemed lik hour , we had scaled that biatch of road . ever curiou , my friend zach who hadnt lived in america that long got right out of the and looked at what andrew wanted to show us . whoa he audibly shout . and looked out over that expanse and saw nothing but the top of trees for mile . we were high cliff overlooking bumfk indiana , and it was sending chills down my spine . core memory man . we sat out over the edge with our guitar , screaming to hear the echoes . if can find the original voice recording , ill post them . after more time sitting and talking , we went back to our hometown and ended the night chilling at our local wendy before going home around 130am . what night . \n\n day 3 . thi on wa slow and relaxing one . we just mettre up in zach garage and made our first step to writing music together . wayne , who haver mentioned by name yet , was only singing at the tim . we were teaching him guitar little by little . that day , andrew finished his little lover song that still play sometimes to thi day . maybe ill post that too if ever get permission . \n\n day 4 . thi wa what youd expect from your typical 19 and 20 year olds . we just drove around more and stopped in rural kentucky where we rarely went . thi was the day got back my grad my final project and remember being vaguely satisfied with it . life wa once again just good overall . \n\n day 5 . thi was big day for . because not only was it another week seeing my boy , but we invited our friend nicol along to go to guitar center with us . my crush . but no one knew that . picked up everyone and squeezed them into my clapped out volkswagen passat and off we went . still hav recording of us singing and playing one of our original song in the expensive guitar room . we laughed and talked about good time the way back and we even very immaturely laughed at poorly printed billboard . andrew saw the billboard which said 1 in tire , 1 in service and recited it in caveman voice in tire , in service ! if you couldnt tell im autistic shit by now , wow . \n\n day 6 , bittersweet one . thi was cookout and campfir at andrews place . upon arriving ther , nicole ran to and leaped into my one free arm , with my guitar cas in the other . thought for sure had chance with her lol . we threw the cheap as kroger burger over the fire and was asked to pay everlong by my friend . what momer , once again . even just typing thi cer believ how lucky was to hav experienced summer lik thi . hope that rogue acoustic guitar is happy somewher in the world and knows regret selling her . the night ended with asking out nicole . she said she only saw us friend , but it wa okay for once . wasnt too upset and we shared nice hug . it wa the last tim saw her until fall . \n\n day 7 . thi tim , it was my aka my parent turn to host everyon . god bles my mom and dad . we all watched air forcer one together and then played card against humanity . favorite moment of mine was when zach asked what revenge fking was and then wayne did an air humping motion and said in batman voic you . killed . my . parent . we all cracked up . thi wa also the night we randomly realized something our most listened to album by far all our little road trip wa here to the good time by florida georgier line . and that gave us an idea . \n\n day 8 . it was my mom and dad hous again . but today it was going to b set plan . we were going to make our very own cover of cruise by florida georgier line . would handle lead guitar and vocal harmonie , whil zach and andrew shared lead vocals and rhythm guitar part . wayne would handle nelly verse . we spent all day recording my ipad using nothing but the built in mic and cheap guitar headphone jack adapter . it all went off without hitch and we said by for the day spent from 6pm to midnight editing it all . the finished product was not too shabby for group of 19 and 20 year old redneck in indiana . it in the group chat and they wer ballistic . they were psyched at how good it sounded . we had finally made music together and recorded it the best we could . \n\n day 9 . our only plan were to just meet up and hangout again possibly pouvoir of mile one of our car good old cross country driv . and that exactly how the day started . we were driving in the middle of nowhere when we came acros the banks of the ohio river in kentucky . randomly had an idea . pulled up the selfie cam in snapchat my phone and asked zach to play our recording through this phone so we could lip sync it in front of the river . and boom the idea to make music video was born . so we hopped right in the and turned the dash cam setup around to face us . and we lip synced our cover of cruise to make music video whil driving down the forgotten backroads of kentuckiana . and for those fleeting moment , all was absolutely perfect in my saoûl . was no longer angry that wasnt popular in school . was no longer hurt by the rejection that followed so long . was no longer worried about what tomorrow would bring . had purpos . and it brought kind of peace cer do enough justice to put in any song . think that was peak life . we all went home walking air , and began editing the video . \n\n morning came . it wa the first day of fall classer for , but knew it would b chill because already had rapport with all the professors . the video was done and it was time to post it facebook . so did it right befor my first two classer and didnt think too much about the reception . was just proud of what we did together . my phone stayed in my pocket for the next two hour but pulled out my ipad for an assignmer and saw multiple facebook message including the group chat . the boy basically said every one of their friend and acquaintance had already liked the video and commented that we sounded great ! so checked my phone and it was taking off ! like 30 share and thousand views and so many comment from peopl knew past and preser . throughout the day it just kept going and going ! when and the guys mettre up that night we were practically fist pumping and high fiving . the video had 70 so share and ter of views for our standard . we kept getting message from locals we barely knew and that was our day of fame for damn sur . we blasted the song our speaker around the town square and headed to get pizza to celebrate in kentucky and we were the happiest wed been in year . the night went and it was more sight seeing , funny moment and just every beautiful thing about growing up in the country . thi wa our last night together . \n\n epilogu \n\n summer was over . andrew got full tim job in another town . zach moved back to his home country , with plan to visit 2x year so . wayne enlisted in the navy and dropped off the face of the earth . missed my friend so badly . but the rest of the year continued to b great . better than could have ever deserved . nicole and reunited and made music video and song together . the video never saw the light of day , but the song itself did . reception to it was good but nothing matched what the boy and accomplished that summer . saw movie with my brother and parent . got and bs for the semester for the first tim in year . christma was even better . thanked god for that summer with my friend and family . iv tried for 9 year to make reunion happen but im afraid it just not in the cards . yet . \n\n am truly very lucky man and will never forget thi summer no matter how old am . thank you all so much for sharing thi with . \n", "author": "Prestigious-Part-697", "date": "2025-06-07T00:00:19", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l562ir/if_youll_have_me_i_want_to_share_the_story_of_the/", "source": "reddit", "language": "en", "sentiment": "positif", "sentiment_score": 0, "retweets": 0, "processed": true}

I keep pushing her away because she and the kids just deserve more than me. I found out that I had \"corrective\" surgery as a baby and was ambiguous down there but my mum preferred to raise a boy. They advised surgery to make more look more like a girl because I tested as 46 XX. I was feminine as a teenager and informed I'm intersex, but I didn't have proper investigations apart from karyotype, which was 46 XX/46 XY. I didn't understand what that meant.

I was told about my surgery and the fact I have female reproductive organs, as well as male. Since I've stopped taking the medication, I don't get facial hair and my body hair is minimal. My breast tissue has increased. My hips have widened even more. I have signs of ovulation even though I'm a father and the surgery as a baby closed my vagina I never knew I had.

My biological dad was a drug addict, and when I was around 3, I guess they split up because he was in a bad situation. I’ve always loved my dad, even when he didn’t show up to our playdates.\n\nWhen I was 5, my mom met my stepdad (who is the person I now call “dad”). They were both young, but he was interested in having a family with the two of us. At first, I hated him because my bio dad would make comments about how he was trying to replace him, but my stepdad never said anything bad about my bio dad. He did so much for my mom and me during those years. We moved in with him, and we started a family. I guess that’s the good part of my life.\n\nThen in primary school, I had a lot of trouble with my classmates and was bullied. High school was a nightmare too. I had severe anxiety, and the pandemic made it even worse. During these years, my mom and dad started having a hard time staying together. My dad would cheat on my mom, and I would notice, but they didn’t separate for several more years. They had so many issues both with each other and with themselves that they became emotionally absent from my life. I didn’t have anyone to talk to except my psychologist.\n\nShe helped me with so many things, like basically learning how to be a person. But my parents just kept complaining about me all the time. I’ve always felt loved, if that means anything but I still felt so alone in my own home.\n\nI also became kind of a “pick me,” not in the sense of chasing male validation, but more like a people pleaser. I would lie or act in certain ways just to feel okay about myself because I felt so bad inside. I started smoking when I was 14.\n\nI’ve tried my best in therapy to become a better person, but each day that passes, I feel like I want to disappear more and more. I love my boyfriend and my best friends, they help me so much but deep down I feel like I should just give up.\n\nI started having suicidal thoughts a long time ago and also began dissociating (I don’t know exactly when). My parents divorced a while ago, and my mom is very depressed. Her own mom passed away, so she’s also grieving.\n\nThe last year we lived together was hell. My dad is a complicated person, and my mom is very submissive (and, to be honest, kind of unstable). They treated each other horribly, and I was caught in the middle. I was mistreated so badly that I had to rebuild my relationship with both of them afterward because I was so angry.\n\nI try every day, but everything just feels so hard.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.

In general, she very often writes me long texts about how she loves me and how she likes me. But after what happened, I don't believe she likes me, despite her apologies and long texts and displays of love. \nThis girl and I are unlikely to be able to meet, because I still have problems with my genitals, I do not have ejaculation, and I also have phimosis.

I feel like I can't think of anything. The only form of comfort I've been able to feel is the tears that cling so desperately to my face. U don't want them to leave as either. Writing this is my last-ditch effort to make sense of myself. Every way I feel contradicts itself. I wish so desperately to forget about all of this, to forget about you. It would be so much easier. But if I forgot, I would feel infinitely more lost. Those thoughts are the only thing I cling on to, to hold on.

But it seems to me that in this “future” you won't be there with me, and if that is the case, then I do not want to move forward. I don't want to move at all.

{"title": "Being the oldest daughter of a single mom", "content": "Since I turned 14 I stopped thinking my mom really loves me because of our dynamic but she's always been so inconsistent and it makes me so unsure of how to view her and our reletionship. I'm the oldest daughter to an immigrant single mom and I've known from a young age that she had to work hard to provide for me and my brother and I've tried to be mindful of that since I was old enough to understand. I would try to not pressure her about buying me things and help around the house since I was 10, but I can't remember a time in my life after I was 7 when me and her genuinely had a healthy releationship for a while.\n\nJust for some context my mom and I immigrated to Europe when I was 5 and we came from a culture where there were always a lot of people around you. In my homecountry I used to always be surrounded by at least 5 people from my extended family all the time because we lived in my grandmothers house where my aunt and cousins also lived so I don't remember spending that much time with only my mom before we immigrated. But when we immigrated it was harder for her to controll me alone so if I misbehaved she would hit me in the first year after, it's not unusual to physically dicipline kids in my culture, but we still had a good relationship overall. If she got mad at me she used to call me names or insult me and she still does that now I just don't care as much but back when I was 6 or 7 that really impacted me and I used to cry over it at night. But then the next day she would just forget it and be nice to me again.\n\nWhen I was 8 she had my little borther and back then we still had a decent relationship except for the argumenst and insults, and she was a good mom to me 70 percent of the time, but as I got older we would have more fights and she would yell at me and then ignore me when I wanted to say how I felt. So every time we had a fight she would say her part and tell me to go away before she got mad, I would try to explain to her what upset me or how I felt and she would shut me out and get mad at me if I didn't leave her alone. There were a few times when I was 10-11 that she would hit me with her shoe if I didn't leave right away.\n\nAs I got older I wanted to have better conversations so we could fix our relatioship so I would try to talk to her about those things often, but she would always gert really mad, insult me and shut me out so after I truned 12 I just started to get more quiet and talk less with her in general. We would go entire days where she just called me for food and said nothing else. We never eat food together, we never had that as a principle, so the most quality time me and her would spend together was if we watched a movie together maybe once a week and a few days after a fight she would go back to being nice.\n\nI'm now more of a quiet person, especially at home, but she would always bring up some insult or say that I don't appreciate what she does for me whenever we are in the same room for a while and that would trigger another fight where I try to explain myself and she shuts me out. And when I was 14 she bought us, because my little brother asked, a Playstation since the schools were locked down because of Covid, and while shopping we somehow got into a fight agian because I when was younger I really wanted a Nintendo or Playstation and I asked her if I could get one and said I wouldn't mind waiting for months if she had to save up slowly even, but she said no because she said I wouldn't use it and it would be a waste.\n\nUntil that point I thought me and her still had a chance of fixing our relatioship and working things out but when she bought the Playstation because my brother asked and I told her I wanted the same thing when I was his age, she said I was lying and that if I really had asked her she would've bought it for me too. After that I started thinking that she never really loved me or valued me as a person, or at least after I got older. I'm now 19 years old and I did stop trying to work things out with her for most of the last 5 years, buts she would always have periods where she did treat me nicer and did do things for me, but it was always after I had to beg her for it.\n\nWhen I was 10 I really wanted a dog and I asked her for it, but she said they were too expenisve and too hard to take care of so I stopped asking. Then when I truned 14 I wanted a cat and I thought that would be perfect because they're cheap and easy to manage, but she still said no because she didn't like cats because they were an evil omen in our culture. I tried to make her understand by having a foster cat for two months and when I asked her again she said she would rather get me a dog instead. When I begged her for a dog she said no and when I begged for a cat and no longer wanted a dog she was willing to buy that instead. This is just some of the stuff she does that made me realize that she didn't truly care about me. But a few weeks later she said okay and even though I was ready to pay for everything for the cat myself, about 500 dollars, she did it for me.\n\nEverytime she treated me coldly I got more and more certain that I never wanted to contact her again after I move out, but then she gets nice again and it makes me waver. And she grew up in our homecountry and I know she has a lot of generational trauma from that so I tend to give her the benefit of the doubt, but then again she never treated my brother the same way she treated me. I want to be understanding and mature but after so many years where I tried my best to fix our relationship to no avail it really hurts to see her be a good mom to my brother but not me. I had another fight with her before writing this post because I brought up that she did hit me when I was 11 and she dismissed it, called me a liar and implied that she doesn't need me as her daughter if I see her with such an evil lense.

It feels like with every new \"improvement\" technology makes, I have to step in to help my elderly parents more and more. Things that they used to be able to do for themselves like CALL THE BLASTED DOCTOR'S OFFICE TO ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION is now locked behind an inscrutable wall of AI idiocy where they ask you to say or type answers to questions before you can talk to a real human, but the AI isn't good enough to understand what they say (I was in the room, they did it correctly) and typing it in also didn't work (we used the method the AI voice told us to).\n\nIt didn't used to be this hard.

{"title": "My boyfriend's younger brother groped me while he was under the influence", "content": "Edit: some of yall are accusing me of using ai to write this which i dont appreciate at all, some people actually learned how to write and state things matter of factly, not everyone relies on chatgpt to write for them. i dont even use chatgpt because i hate ai\n\nRight after last Christmas, my (18f, at the time) brother (17m) had five of his friends (15/16m) stay the night at our house. I have always enjoyed spending time with him and his friends, one of his friends includes my boyfriend's younger brother, i'll call him P. We all know each other because we go to church together and we used to go to the same private school before I graduated. I have been friends with P since before I was even friends with my bf, so for at least 3 years at the time.\n\nMy brother had gotten his hands on some vodka and all of us had ingested some. I didn't have a lot, only like a sip. I wanted to keep my eye on them to make sure they didn't get too out of control, and also I just enjoy their company (sometimes lol) because they are funny. \n\nP is like a younger brother to me as I have watched him grow up to be a young man, and if all goes as planned he will be my brother in law one day. He has always been the most nice to me out of my brothers friends and our relationship is more familial than it is friends.\n\nP (15 at the time) had ingested at least 2 or 3 shots worth of vodka. He was drunk. I was cooking fried rice for the boys in the kitchen and all was chill. P came up to me and put his arm around my shoulder as I was cooking. It didnt seem sexual or anything, it just seemed like genuine affection. I said to him \"aw, I love you P\" (not in a weird way just expressing it like I would to a family member). He moved his hand and squeezed my breast for a second. I pushed him away and said \"What are you doing?!\" and I looked  at him feeling betrayed and violated. He looked surprised and confused as though he wasnt really aware of what had just happened, he didnt reply. A moment of silence and me looking at him. \"Don't grope me.\" I said to him. He appeared  to have registered it and immediately started apologizing profusely. I was really shocked and irritated as this hasn't ever happened to me, but I didn't feel as though it was intentional either. I didn't really think, I just said \"I forgive you, now go away go back to the room.\" and shoved him lightly into the direction of the room. \n\nI finished cooking the rice. I didn't say anything to anyone or mention it again. When I brought the rice to the boys P was laying on his sleeping bag looking very solemn. I told everyone to come get their food. For a few minutes multiple people were in the kitchen, then eventually it was just me and P. He had started to talk about how he is a lustful person and he looked very sad. He opened up to me about how having devices at a young age \"ruined him\". He apologized to me again and again and I told him I still love him like hes my little brother and I empathized with him as I know how detrimental pornography is, especially for young men. He started to cry, I gave him a small hug and sat next to him until he was ready to go back to the room.\n\nIt was hurtful what he did to me and I still think about it at least every other day, but I still love him and care for him as well. I don't  feel as though I was raped or touched inappropriately with malicious intention. My boyfriend is incredibly close with his little brother and they are  like best friends. I always thought I would tell bf if someone had done something like that to me, but it happened with his own younger brother and I felt like there was nothing to gain from telling him aside from throwing a wrench into their relationship.\n\nP and I haven't  talked about it since that night and I haven't told anyone, not my brother, not my bf, not even my closest friend. I don't know if I ever will tell. I don't have any intention of severing ties or anything like that as that would only suck for my own life, I can't change the past.\n\nAnyway I just wanted to get this secret off my chest.

{"title": "Mom doesn't want me and my sister to go on a school trip, even though we're adults.", "content": "I am almost 20 and my sister is 22. Last year we had a school trip, it was over the weekend and we left around 5pm on Friday and got back around 6pm on Sunday. The only reason we were able to go then, was because she went out of state with her boyfriend so she wasn't by herself. \n\nThis time - it's the same program as the first trip - it's 5 days, technically 4 because the first and last day are half days. She has known about this since the moment we came back from the weekend trip. And when we told her the very first time, she got this look on her face, like she's mad about something but won't say anything, and everytime after she would get the same look on her face when it was mentioned. \n\nWe didn't find out the date until May 20th, and didn't tell her until last week, because we were scared to tell her, because we know it will end with her yelling at us and guilt tripping us, and a bad argument starting. Mail came for my sister, and my aunt (who lives right next door) held onto it so she could give it to my sister (it was from the program, giving details about drop-off/pick-up and what we would need) I chose that moment to tell her that the counselor emailed me the link to their website and I told her when the dates were. She got the same look on her face and had an upset tone to her voice and she said, \"I thought he was supposed to put a stop to all these\"\n\nAnd mouthed to our aunt that she should have given the mail to her, even the one my sister got for a college. The conversation was dropped after that. I'm scared to bring it up to her again, my chest has felt heavy since then, and when I think about bringing it up, I can feel my heart speed up and my chest feels heavier. She has given multiple excuses for why she doesn't want us to go\n\n1. She can't take care of all the animals (her friend said he will take the dog out, so she would only have to feed and water two cats) \n\n2. We have to go through things in the basement (she wants to move to a different state - and doesn't care that we don't want to move there) \n\n3. She doesn't want us bringing bugs home (we didn't have that problem last time, and to be extra sure, we checked everything) \n\nThere were others but I'm not putting all that. This morning she took her friend to work, and I went with them. He brought up our trip and that he would take the dog out. She said \"we still haven't discussed them going\". My chest felt heavy again and I just wanted to scream and cry. But I also feel selfish, because at her last doctors appointment she got a blood test done to check things, and they found something wrong with her results, that it could be cancer or some abnormality. And that was the other reason this morning - that she needed to get more testing done to see what it is (we have to go with her to appointments). I feel bad for wanting to go, but at the same time we literally never get to do anything, unless it's something she wants. \n\nFor years she has kept us inside, we never got to do a lot of things other kids were able to growing up - I now have social anxiety, and my sister has separation anxiety and panic attacks. We are basically dependent on her. We don't have a job, we don't have a licence, we don't even have an ID. The one thing we really want to do, and she's mad because we won't be with her for a few days. And whenever we try bringing up how she'll have to get used to this if we go to college and move out, she never responds to it. Me and my sister have already talked to each other, and that if she won't take us, we would have to ake the bus there (which this place is a lot closer than the last time. It's like a 15 minute drive) and I already know she'll either go to the college and and probably start something or we'll be yelled at when we come back.

Only way I (M22 if it's relevant) can describe it is my vibes being off, but to an absolutely rancid degree that makes others not want to approach/ deal with me. The tipping point that made me make this throwaway account and write this rant was a job that had me for trial days, where I manned a station that's supposed to have two people alone and did a decent enough job keeping it clean (it's a kids play space so it's always gonna get a little messy) and came from a break to find it destroyed.

{"title": "Bestfriend got married today and Im feeling so alone and extra sad.", "content": "Hey Guys!  \nSo Im a girl, 25 years old and I had a best friend who is of the same age (also girl). We've been friends since 1st standard. We went to different schools for higher secondary and bachelor's degree. Later, we went to the same city for post grad and later found jobs and rented a 2BHK. (Our families our also good friends too, cause we come from the same city) We were very close, like sisters you know. So we would do crazy shit like go partying every weekend, we got into smoking marijuana and would literally smoke up all the time since both of us worked from home. Basically, saying \"We've seen it all together is an understatement\". (I can't say everything but we've done some crazyy stuff like hanging out with men twice our age to doing lines with some random strangers in a 3rd class train toilet - WE LISTEN AND WE DON'T JUDGE). We were so addicted to weed that we promised that we would have edible's on the day of our marriage and chill. Guys, it was her idea all along. We knew everything about each other i.e to the smallest things like our favourite food to the most personal information like making out with a guy. Im more of an introvert, I don't go out much, but she's feral. She would go on dates, like every other day bring home guys. I would too, but she was the extrovert among the two of us. So this was how it was for 3 years. This whole time, she was searching for love. She wasn't going on these dates, just for the sake of it. After every date, she would feel so bad that it didn't work out, or after failed situationships, talking stages etc., she would cry to me saying that she couldn't find the kind of love she was searching. By this time her parents had also started searching for a guy get her married. She would even sign up in matrimonial apps by herself and try finding guys and all that crap. When we turned 23, she dated a guy who I knew and didn't like - since we lived together, I had only one condition and it was not to bring the guy home. But she didn't listen and brought him home without my knowledge. I got pissed and stopped talking to her. By the time, we had stayed in that house for 2 years, and our lease was up. At that point, we were not talking to each other, so I didn't want to stay there anymore. I packed and came back home. We didn't speak to eachother for 3-4 months. She called me once, put everything in the past, then we spoke after that. She came home by then. We got even closer, like we would call each other all the time. Since both of us were home, we didn't have much to do. Work from home, discuss movies, series, peer pressure each other to Swiggy and talk smack about others. Even while we were at home, we couldn't stop smoking weed, so we scored and would meet each other every week, smoke up somewhere and would belt non veg in some nice restaurant. She doesn't know how to drive, so I would take my car every week and that's how we would meet. All this while, she would feel bad saying we are 25 and we aren't finding the love of our lives... My parents had not started seeing a guy for me, but for her since it was already 2-2 1/2 years, she used to get so anxious, saying nobody likes her and she will not find love.. I would get irritated sometimes, but then Im a little emotionally aware like that, so I would feel bad for her, console her ask her to be patient, feed eachother some delulu shit like he'll fall from the sky, we dont chase we attract - all that shit. Our birthday ritual was for both of our birthday's we would try travelling or go for a fancy dinner. We've been to Goa, Pondy, Varkala, Chennai for both of our birthdays. Both of us have never travelled out of the country. So we promised, before we get married we should do a trip to Thailand. 1. cause its cheap 2. WEED - (Come on guys). Her parents are military strict, my parents are strict but far better than hers. We would laugh at random things, you know how it is between 2 best friends right. We would talk shit about everyone, we hated the same people, we knew everything about each other- family drama all of that. One day, 10 months back she called me saying they had found a guy for her and everything is looking good so probably this is it. Obviously I was happy, like really really happy, cause I know how much desperate she was to get that love. After that we had met as usual as we meet every week for lunch. She suddenly says, she will not smoke up (which I understand cause the dynamics change after marriage), stop drinking and not eat non-veg (We were both foodies - in the city were we lived we would smoke up and go to crazy food places). We decided we would only get married to guys who smoke up, or basically you know be with someone of the same wave length. But the guy she okay'd doesn't even drink. I get all of that, we were doing things that are not accepted by society so its fine. Now, she is someone who will not even call her parents and talk to them let alone her grandparents. But then she calls her soon to be mother in law everyday - calls her AMMA (like dudee???), falls on her feet (Like bruh have you ever done that with your parents?) she calls the boy's grandmother everyday. We met after her engagement for lunch as usual and the whole time she was sitting there talking to his grandmother???!! She hated sneakers, she doesn't like formula 1, never even knew a car name - but since the guy said he likes all these she would ask me what's a DRS, what's the most trending sneakers currently and would showcase in a way that she also likes the same thing. I get it she likes the guy, but she didn't have to pretend!!! I was seeing her change right in front of my eyes, and I was so confused as to who am I even friends with? The International trip that we promised each other, haha out the window she never even brought that up again.  \nA little about me - I hate when someone promises something and does things otherwise. Im very short tempered. I love my friends so much but if I get the ick that's it, Im never going back to the person again no matter what happens, or under any circumstances. Maybe I over reacted and she was joking the whole time and I took everything seriously, I just don't know man. I have no other friends. She was my only best friend.  \nSo, I slowly distanced myself from her. She would call and talk about the guy the whole time. We stopped texting each other like we used to, we stopped calling each other. She tried multiple times. But then, I got the ick and I couldn't do it anymore. I was the one who stopped talking to her but today it hurts a little extra.  \nSince we have family in common, my mum got the news that she got married today, she didn't invite me- no brainer. It's been 6 months since we stopped talking but today after my mother mentioned the marriage, I felt extra sad and so lonely. I miss her every single day, every second, each time I see a reel which mentions about friends I want to send it to her, but she's not there. Even if my other friends sends the same thing - I cant relate to it.  \nAfter we stopped talking I said chuck everything and took solo trip to Thailand, did everything we had in mind but alone - It was still fun though, also went to Vietnam made friends and just booked my tickets to Singapore and Malaysia for a month. I do have other friends, I am a single child and always grew up with a lot of friends, but she was my best friend you know.  \nIts all fun, but that best friend void still lingers. Guess I'll just have to live with it.  \nNow, I don't like to talk to anyone, I don't want to make new friends, I don't even want to try, to find a loyal guy - that's a whole different story. So now, I just sit at home and smoke weed alone :)  \nI obviously want to find a guy and settle down, but I just want a male version of me. The thing is Im okay being alone, Im not like I need a partner to be happy you know. If I have a partner I'll be the happiest, right now Im happy - not much difference tbh.  \nIm not someone who expresses my emotions, but my heart is so heavy and I cant eat.   \nIDK guys am I at fault? Did I overreact?", "cleaned_content": "hey guy !  \n so im girl , 25 year old and had best friend who i of the same ag also girl . we' ve been friend since 1st standard . we wer to school for higher
